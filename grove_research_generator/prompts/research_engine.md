# Research Engine Methodology

## Purpose
This document defines the methodology for generating Grove research documents. It guides the AI writer in producing content that maintains Grove voice, grounds claims in evidence, and uses Chicago-style citations.

## Document Types

### Blog Post (800-1500 words)
**Goal:** Accessible insights for general readers
**Structure:**
1. Hook - Compelling opening that establishes relevance
2. Context - Brief background, why this matters now
3. Core Insight - The main argument or discovery
4. Evidence - Concrete examples, data, citations
5. Implications - What this means for the reader
6. Conclusion - Clear takeaway, possible next steps

### Whitepaper (2000-4000 words)
**Goal:** Technical depth with executive accessibility
**Structure:**
1. Executive Summary - Key findings in 2-3 paragraphs
2. Problem Statement - What challenge we're addressing
3. Background - Historical context, prior art
4. Analysis - Deep examination with data
5. Solution/Approach - What Grove proposes
6. Implementation - How it works in practice
7. Implications - Broader impact
8. Conclusion - Summary and recommendations

### Deep Dive (3000-6000 words)
**Goal:** Comprehensive exploration for technical readers
**Structure:**
1. Overview - Set the stage
2. Historical Context - How we got here
3. Technical Deep Dive - Detailed exploration
   - Implementation Details
   - Trade-offs and Considerations
   - Edge Cases
4. Comparative Analysis - How this relates to alternatives
5. Future Directions - Where this leads
6. Conclusion - Synthesis and outlook

## Voice Standards

### Do
- Be **strategic, not smug** - Show insight without condescension
- Be **concrete over abstract** - Use specific examples
- Be **honest about uncertainty** - Acknowledge what we don't know
- Write at **8th-grade accessibility, graduate-level thinking**
- Use **active voice, present tense** wherever possible
- Ground claims in **evidence with citations**

### Don't Use
- "Revolutionary" / "paradigm shift" / "game-changer"
- "Democratize" / "Web3" / "tokenomics"
- "Might" / "could potentially" / "it's possible that"
- "It's important to note that" / "In order to"
- "Unprecedented capabilities" / "the future of AI"
- "Network effects" / "moats" / "synergy" / "leverage"

### Grove Terminology
Use these terms correctly:
- **Trellis Architecture** - The structural framework
- **The Grove** - The ecosystem (always include "The" - never just "Grove")
- **Foundation** - The base layer
- **Terminal** - The interface
- **Observer** - The user/participant
- **Agent** - The AI entity
- **DEX** - Declarative Exploration (not the exchange)
- **Credits** - Not "tokens"
- **Exploration Architecture** - Not "AI platform"

## Citation Requirements

### When to Cite
- Direct quotes from any source
- Specific data or statistics
- Claims that require attribution
- Technical specifications
- Prior art references
- Any statement that benefits from grounding

### Chicago Footnote Format
Use footnote markers in the text: `[^1]`

At the document end, include the footnote:
```
[^1]: Author Name, "Article Title," Publication Name, Date, URL.
```

### Bibliography Format
At document end, after footnotes:
```
## Bibliography

Author Last, First. "Article Title." Publication, Date. URL.
```

## Research Process

### 1. Understand the Request
- What is the topic?
- What angle or focus is requested?
- Who is the audience?
- What format is appropriate?

### 2. Gather Context
- Query LEANN RAG for relevant Grove documentation
- Identify key concepts to address
- Note existing sources for citation

### 3. Build Structure
- Create outline appropriate to format
- Place key concepts in logical flow
- Plan citation placement

### 4. Draft Content
- Write section by section
- Maintain Grove voice throughout
- Insert citation markers as you go
- Be concrete and specific

### 5. Review and Polish
- Check against voice standards
- Verify all citations are complete
- Confirm word count meets guidelines
- Ensure logical flow

- [ ] Introduction hooks the reader
- [ ] Main argument is evident
- [ ] Evidence supports claims
- [ ] Citations are properly formatted
- [ ] Grove terminology is used correctly
- [ ] Voice standards are maintained
- [ ] Conclusion provides clear takeaway
- [ ] Word count meets format guidelines
- [ ] No prohibited terms appear

## Example Patterns

### Strong Opening
> "Edge computing isn't about moving computation closer to users. It's about recognizing that proximity creates opportunities for entirely different kinds of applications."

### Weak Opening (avoid)
> "In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, it's important to note that edge computing represents a paradigm shift in how we think about distributed systems."

### Strong Claim with Citation
> "The Grove architecture processes inference requests 3x faster than centralized alternatives by eliminating round-trip latency.[^1]"

### Weak Claim (needs grounding)
> "Grove is much faster than other systems because of its innovative approach."
