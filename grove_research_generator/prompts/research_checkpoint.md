## Grove Terminology Reference

### Core Architecture Terms

| Term | Definition | Don't Say |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **Trellis Architecture** | The structural framework enabling distributed AI inference | "AI infrastructure", "cloud platform" |
| **The Grove** | The ecosystem of interconnected nodes and agents (always use "The Grove", not just "Grove") | "network", "platform", "Grove" (without "The") |
| **Foundation** | The base layer providing core services | "backend", "infrastructure layer" |
| **Terminal** | The interface layer for user interaction | "frontend", "client", "UI" |
| **Observer** | A participant in the Grove ecosystem | "user", "customer" |
| **Agent** | An AI entity operating within Grove | "bot", "AI assistant" |

### Technical Terms

| Term | Definition | Context |
|------|------------|---------|
| **DEX** | Declarative Exploration - the programming paradigm | Not a cryptocurrency exchange |
| **Credits** | The resource unit in Grove | Not "tokens" |
| **Ratchet** | One-way progress mechanism | Named concept, capitalize |
| **Distributed Inference** | AI processing across nodes | Core capability |
| **Exploration Architecture** | The overarching design philosophy | Not "AI platform" |

## Voice Calibration

### Confidence Levels

**High Confidence** (state directly):
- Facts about Grove architecture
- Documented capabilities
- Published benchmarks

**Medium Confidence** (qualify appropriately):
- Comparisons with other systems
- Performance claims without specific benchmarks
- Future roadmap items

**Low Confidence** (acknowledge uncertainty):
- Predictions about market adoption
- Claims about competitor behavior
- Unverified third-party information

### Example Transformations

**Before:** "Grove will revolutionize the AI industry"
**After:** "Grove introduces a different model for AI inference distribution"

**Before:** "This might potentially help users"
**After:** "This helps users by [specific mechanism]"

**Before:** "It's important to note that the system is fast"
**After:** "The system responds in under 50ms for typical queries"

## Common Issues to Avoid

### Structural
- [ ] Missing introduction or conclusion
- [ ] Abrupt transitions between sections
- [ ] Insufficient evidence for claims
- [ ] Citations clustered rather than distributed

### Voice
- [ ] Passive voice overuse
- [ ] Hedging language ("might", "could potentially")
- [ ] Filler phrases ("It's important to note")
- [ ] Buzzwords from avoid list

### Technical
- [ ] Incorrect Grove terminology
- [ ] Unsupported performance claims
- [ ] Missing citation for specific data
- [ ] Inconsistent formatting
