## Terminology Preferences

### The Grove (not "Grove")
- **Pattern:** Always use "The Grove" with the article, never just "Grove" alone
- **Why:** "Grove" alone reads awkwardly; "The Grove" is the proper name
- **Source:** Trellis Architecture blog post (2026-01-18)
- **Examples:**
  - ❌ "Grove's Trellis Architecture..."
  - ✅ "The Grove's Trellis Architecture..."
  - ❌ "In Grove, agents collaborate..."
  - ✅ "In The Grove, agents collaborate..."
