# Claude Agent Settings
# Tune these parameters to control API behavior

writer:
  model: "claude-opus-4-20250514"  # Using Opus for larger context window + quality
  max_tokens: 32000  # Opus supports larger output
  temperature: 0.3  # Lower = more consistent

reviewer:
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"  # Sonnet sufficient for review
  max_tokens: 4000
  temperature: 0.2  # Even lower for validation

# Model options:
# - claude-sonnet-4-20250514 (default, good balance)
# - claude-opus-4-20250514 (highest quality, larger context, slower, more expensive)
# - claude-haiku-3-5-20241022 (fastest, cheapest, for simple docs)

# Note: Switched to Opus for processing 36 REVISE documents that failed with Sonnet
# due to context window limits. Documents range from 10KB to 213KB.
