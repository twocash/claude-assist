## Rewrite: 260100-v-research-coordination-physics-validates-dex.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source content is well-structured technical research brief that aligns strongly with current Grove positioning. Content is recent (January 2026) and uses mostly current terminology, but contains some legacy framing and could be tightened for clarity and impact.

### Key Changes Made
- Streamlined opening paragraph to lead with core insight
- Replaced "DEX/Trellis Architecture" with "Trellis Architecture" (DEX is design philosophy, not architectural component)
- Removed throat-clearing phrases and academic hedging where not substantive
- Strengthened active voice throughout
- Clarified technical explanations for accessibility
- Preserved intentional uncertainty in research validation sections
- Tightened conclusion to emphasize Grove's first-mover advantage

### Flags for Review
- Academic citations and technical details preserved as-is (appear accurate)
- Maintained substantive hedging about research applications and future developments
- No strategic positioning changes made
