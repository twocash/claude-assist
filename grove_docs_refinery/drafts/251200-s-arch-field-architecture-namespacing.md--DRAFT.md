## Rewrite: 251200-s-arch-field-architecture-namespacing.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is well-structured technical architecture spec but uses legacy terminology ("The Grove Foundation" vs current "Grove AI Foundation") and could benefit from clearer strategic framing aligned with exploration architecture positioning.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated "The Grove Foundation" → "Grove AI Foundation" throughout
- Strengthened opening to emphasize exploration architecture framing
- Clarified that Fields enable exploration vs. generic "knowledge work"
- Maintained all technical specifications and implementation details
- Preserved honest assessment of MVP limitations and deferred features
- Added context about how Fields serve Grove's exploration-first mission

### Flags for Review
- Technical implementation details assume reader familiarity with Grove's broader architecture
- Attribution economy section anticipates future credit system that isn't fully specified yet
- Complex composite field merging logic may need additional validation during implementation
