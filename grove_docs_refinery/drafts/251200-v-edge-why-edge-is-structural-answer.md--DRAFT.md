### Diagnosis Summary
This document contains strong strategic thinking but uses legacy "edge intelligence" terminology and generic distributed AI framing. The core thesis about capability propagation aligns with Grove's Ratchet thesis, but needs updating to current positioning around exploration architecture and specific terminology.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated title and core framing from "edge intelligence" to "distributed AI infrastructure"
- Replaced "The-Grove.ai Foundation" with "Grove AI Foundation"
- Updated "tokens" → "Credits" throughout
- Strengthened the capability propagation argument using Grove's Ratchet thesis language
- Clarified hybrid architecture positioning (local + cloud bridge)
- Maintained all probability estimates and risk assessments (intentional honesty)
- Preserved academic consortium recommendations but aligned with Grove's university partnership strategy

### Flags for Review
- Document makes specific claims about Grove Foundation's business model and positioning that should be verified against current strategy
- References to "The-Grove.ai" website should be updated to reflect current branding
- Some sections discuss Grove as infrastructure provider - confirm this aligns with current go-to-market
