## Rewrite: 251200-s-pattern-copilot-configurator.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is well-aligned with current Grove positioning and terminology. Strong technical vision that demonstrates Trellis Architecture principles. Minor terminology updates needed (Declarative Editing→DEX, some legacy framings).

### Key Changes Made
- Updated "Declarative Editing" to "Declarative Exploration (DEX)" throughout
- Replaced "The Grove" with "Grove" for consistency
- Strengthened connection to Trellis Architecture and exploration thesis
- Enhanced strategic messaging around university partnerships
- Clarified model capability claims to avoid overpromising

### Flags for Review
- None - document is strategically sound and technically accurate
