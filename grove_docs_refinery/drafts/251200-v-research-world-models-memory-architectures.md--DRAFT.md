## Rewrite: 251200-v-research-world-models-memory-architectures.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is a solid technical survey but uses legacy terminology ("distributed AI agents" vs "exploration architecture") and generic AI positioning. Strong technical content with good research synthesis, but needs alignment with Grove's current strategic frame and voice standards.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated title and framing to reflect Grove's exploration architecture positioning
- Replaced "distributed AI agents" with Grove-specific terminology throughout
- Strengthened opening thesis to emphasize architectural insight over capability race
- Removed hedging language while preserving substantive technical caveats
- Updated terminology: agents → AI entities, users → Observers, tokens → processing units
- Emphasized exploration vs optimization framing in recommendations
- Maintained technical depth and research citations (this content works well)

### Flags for Review
- Technical architecture recommendations are solid and align with current Grove thinking
- Research citations and benchmarks appear current and accurate
- No major strategic positioning conflicts identified

# World Models and Memory Architectures for Grove's Exploration Infrastructure

**Hybrid neuro-symbolic world models, hierarchical memory systems, and edge-optimized inference represent the three architectural pillars for building persistent, locally-intelligent AI entities.** This technical brief synthesizes research on world modeling, memory architectures, and knowledge propagation to inform Grove's exploration architecture—an infrastructure emphasizing local cognition, hybrid processing, and persistent intelligence. The key insight: **no single approach dominates**. Optimal exploration architectures combine compact latent models for real-time control, transformer models for long-context reasoning, hierarchical memory for persistence, and principled cloud-to-edge knowledge transfer.
