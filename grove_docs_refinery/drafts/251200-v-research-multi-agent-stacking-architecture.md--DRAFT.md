## Rewrite: 251200-v-research-multi-agent-stacking-architecture.md
### Diagnosis Summary
This document captures relevant external research on multi-agent coordination patterns from a TikTok developer. Content is technically sound but uses legacy terminology and lacks clear connection to Grove's exploration architecture positioning.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology (Multi-Agent Systems → Agent coordination, LLM → AI models)
- Strengthened Grove relevance section with current architectural framing
- Removed buzzword language ("Future-Proof," generic optimization framing)
- Connected research to DEX (Declarative Exploration) principles
- Maintained honest assessment of applicability without overselling

### Flags for Review
- Technical accuracy of orchestrator-worker pattern mapping to Grove's hybrid architecture
- Whether this research warrants inclusion in knowledge commons or is primarily reference material
