### Diagnosis Summary
Source document has solid practical vision but uses legacy terminology ("tokens" vs "credits") and needs alignment with current positioning. The three-tier model is strong but needs voice tightening and architectural updates.

### Key Changes Made
- Fixed terminology: "tokens" → "credits", "village" → agent community terminology
- Updated positioning: Emphasized exploration architecture over generic "everyday AI"
- Strengthened competitive differentiation with current strategic framing
- Tightened prose by removing hedging and corporate language
- Aligned economic model with current credit system understanding

### Flags for Review
- Competitive claims against ChatGPT/Claude may need validation
- Knowledge Commons implementation details should align with current roadmap
- Economic tiers should match current pricing strategy
