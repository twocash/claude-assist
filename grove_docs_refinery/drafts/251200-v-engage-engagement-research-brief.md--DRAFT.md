### Diagnosis Summary
The source document is well-researched and empirically grounded, with strong academic citations and clear acknowledgment of risks. Main issues are outdated terminology ("gardeners" for Observers, "villages" for communities) and some generic framing that doesn't emphasize Grove's exploration architecture positioning.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology: gardeners→Observers, villages→agent communities, etc.
- Emphasized exploration vs. entertainment framing throughout
- Strengthened connection to Grove's specific architecture (Diary System, Kinetic Stream)
- Clarified Grove's differentiation from AI companion apps
- Maintained all research citations and empirical grounding
- Preserved risk assessments and honest caveats (intentional intellectual honesty)

### Flags for Review
- The "dopamine delivery vehicle" framing may need strategic review - it's provocative but potentially off-brand for exploration architecture positioning
- Risk mitigation recommendations could be expanded to align with current design principles
