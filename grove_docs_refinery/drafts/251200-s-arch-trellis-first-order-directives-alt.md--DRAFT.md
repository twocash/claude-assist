### Diagnosis Summary
This is a comprehensive architectural document from the Grove Foundation's "living constitution" that effectively communicates the DEX methodology and Field-based architecture. The content is technically sound and strategically aligned, requiring primarily terminology updates and voice refinement rather than structural changes.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology mappings (Models→Credits economics not applicable here, but "users"→"Observers" where relevant)
- Strengthened the core philosophy section with clearer Grove positioning
- Refined voice to be more concrete and less abstract
- Enhanced the implementation roadmap with current Grove state
- Added clearer connections to Grove's exploration architecture thesis
- Maintained all technical specifications and architectural details

### Flags for Review
- None - document aligns well with current positioning and technical architecture
