## Rewrite: 260104-s-exec-bedrock-sprint-contract-v1.1.md
### Diagnosis Summary
This is a technical contract document governing development methodology, written December 2025-January 2026. The content is current and aligns well with Grove's architectural positioning. Primary updates needed are terminology consistency and voice tightening.

### Key Changes Made
- Fixed terminology: "tokens" → "credits" (one instance)
- Removed throat-clearing phrases ("it operates as", "this contract may be")
- Activated passive constructions throughout
- Streamlined section headers and descriptions
- Maintained all technical precision and binding language (appropriate for contract)

### Flags for Review
- Document maintains intentionally formal/legal tone appropriate for binding contract
- All architectural requirements and checklists preserved exactly
- Technical implementation details verified against current state
