### Diagnosis Summary
This is a comprehensive white paper from December 2025 that presents Grove's core thesis through "The Ratchet" concept and describes the full system architecture. The source content is relatively current and well-aligned with Grove's positioning, but contains some legacy terminology and could benefit from tighter prose and updated framing.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology mappings (tokens→credits, users→observers/gardeners, etc.)
- Strengthened "exploration architecture" positioning throughout
- Tightened prose by removing hedging and throat-clearing language
- Enhanced technical descriptions to match current implementation
- Preserved all intentional honesty in risk and constraint sections
- Improved voice consistency and accessibility

### Flags for Review
- Economic projections should be validated against current models
- Timeline estimates may need updating based on current development pace
- Some technical specifications should be cross-referenced with latest architecture docs
