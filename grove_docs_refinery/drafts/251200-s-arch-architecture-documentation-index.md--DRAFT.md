## Rewrite: 251200-s-arch-architecture-documentation-index.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is a technical index from December 2024 that's already reasonably current but uses some legacy terminology and lacks Grove's evolved strategic framing. Structure is solid but needs voice alignment and terminology updates.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated title to reflect "Trellis Architecture" terminology
- Replaced "DEX" with "Declarative Exploration" for clarity
- Enhanced overview to connect architecture to exploration thesis
- Strengthened language around Field-scoped operations
- Updated document conventions to reflect current voice standards
- Maintained all technical specificity and structural organization

### Flags for Review
- Confirmed all referenced file paths remain accurate
- Technical implementation details preserved as-is
- MVP scope accurately reflects December 2024 state
