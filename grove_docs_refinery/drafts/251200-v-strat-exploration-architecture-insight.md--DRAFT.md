## Rewrite: 251200-v-strat-exploration-architecture-insight.md
### Diagnosis Summary
This document is current and well-aligned with Grove's strategic positioning. The core framing is strong and the historical parallel is effective. Main needs are minor terminology updates and voice consistency improvements.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology: "LLMs" → "AI models" for broader applicability
- Strengthened voice consistency with more active constructions
- Clarified "The Grove Foundation" organizational reference
- Removed redundant provenance notes (streamlined to single version)
- Enhanced precision in technical descriptions

### Flags for Review
- Research citation formatting could be standardized across Grove documents
- Consider whether this strategic insight should reference other Grove positioning docs
