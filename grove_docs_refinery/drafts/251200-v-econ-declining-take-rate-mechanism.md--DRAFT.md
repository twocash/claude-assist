## Rewrite: 251200-v-econ-declining-take-rate-mechanism.md
### Diagnosis Summary
This document presents solid economic modeling but uses some legacy terminology and could strengthen Grove's strategic positioning. The risk analysis and model structure are strong and should be preserved.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated "The Grove" to "Grove" for consistency
- Replaced "take-rate" with "take rate" (cleaner)
- Changed "rake" to "efficiency tax" to better reflect the mechanism's purpose
- Strengthened the opening positioning to emphasize exploration architecture
- Clarified the commitment device framing
- Updated copyright and provenance formatting

### Flags for Review
- None - the mathematical model and risk assessment are sound as written
