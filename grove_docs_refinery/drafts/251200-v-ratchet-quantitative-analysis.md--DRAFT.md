### Diagnosis Summary
This document provides strong quantitative backing for Grove's Ratchet Thesis using solid research data. The core analysis and models are sound, but the framing needs updating to reflect current strategic positioning and terminology alignment.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated title to emphasize support for Grove's exploration architecture rather than generic "infrastructure thesis"
- Replaced "infrastructure" with "exploration architecture" where strategically appropriate
- Clarified hybrid architecture as bridge strategy, not permanent state
- Strengthened the opening hook with Grove's current positioning
- Maintained all quantitative models and data (these are solid)
- Preserved honest assessment language in sensitivity analysis and conclusion sections
- Updated terminology: "nodes/communities" → "agents and communities"

### Flags for Review
- The $300B centralized AI investment figure should be verified for currency
- Consider if any of the milestone dates need adjustment based on more recent capability assessments
