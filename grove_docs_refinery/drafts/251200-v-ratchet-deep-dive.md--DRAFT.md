### Diagnosis Summary
Strong technical document with solid data foundation and appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment. Main issues are legacy terminology ("Worldsmiths" → "Observers", "Gardeners" → context-appropriate terms), some hedging in claims sections, and framing that could be more directly tied to Grove's exploration architecture positioning.

### Key Changes Made
- Fixed terminology: Worldsmiths→Observers, Gardeners→users, The-Grove.ai Foundation→Grove AI Foundation
- Strengthened claims by removing unnecessary hedging while preserving intentional caveats
- Aligned framing with exploration architecture positioning
- Tightened prose and removed throat-clearing
- Updated organization references to match current structure

### Flags for Review
- Technical projections are substantial claims - validate against latest METR data
- Economic models around GPO comparisons may need legal review
- Scenario matrices contain specific numerical predictions
