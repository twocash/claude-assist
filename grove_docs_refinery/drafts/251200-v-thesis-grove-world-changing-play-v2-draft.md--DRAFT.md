## Rewrite: 251200-v-thesis-grove-world-changing-play-v2-draft.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document contains strong strategic insights and compelling framing, but suffers from legacy terminology ("tokens," "distributed intelligence"), inconsistent positioning, and some crypto-adjacent language. The horse analogy is powerful and should be preserved. Technical descriptions need alignment with current Trellis Architecture.

### Key Changes Made
- Fixed terminology mappings (distributed intelligence → exploration architecture, tokens → credits, etc.)
- Aligned positioning with current "exploration architecture" framing
- Updated technical descriptions to match Trellis Architecture
- Removed crypto/Web3 signaling language
- Strengthened voice consistency throughout
- Preserved intentional honesty in limitations section
- Updated governance section to reflect current Foundation approach

### Flags for Review
- Horse analogy framing is compelling but may need validation for audience appropriateness
- Economic model descriptions should be cross-checked with latest Grove Economics Deep Dive
- Governance transition mechanisms may need update based on recent Advisory Council feedback
