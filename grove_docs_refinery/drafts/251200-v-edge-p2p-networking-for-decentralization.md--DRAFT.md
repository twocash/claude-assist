## Rewrite: 251200-v-edge-p2p-networking-for-decentralization.md
### Diagnosis Summary
This is a technical deep dive from December 2025 that's largely current but uses legacy "decentralized AI networks" framing instead of "distributed AI infrastructure." The content is academically rigorous with strong citations, but needs terminology alignment and strategic reframing around exploration architecture.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated title and framing from "decentralized AI networks" to "distributed AI infrastructure"
- Replaced "decentralized AI" with "distributed AI infrastructure" throughout
- Changed "decentralization" to "distribution" where appropriate
- Updated executive summary to emphasize exploration architecture context
- Maintained all technical accuracy and academic rigor
- Preserved honest assessments about NAT traversal limitations and hybrid architecture necessity

### Flags for Review
- Document is highly technical - confirm target audience alignment
- All academic citations preserved as-is (assumed current and accurate)
- Maintained specific performance metrics and technical parameters
