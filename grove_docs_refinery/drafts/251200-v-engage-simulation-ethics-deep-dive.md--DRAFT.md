## Rewrite: 251200-v-engage-simulation-ethics-deep-dive.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document from December 2025 contains mostly current terminology and strategic positioning, but includes some legacy terms ("The-Grove.ai Foundation" vs "Grove AI Foundation") and minor voice inconsistencies. The document's honest assessment of engagement risks and technical limitations aligns well with current positioning on acknowledging tensions rather than papering over them.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated organization name: "The-Grove.ai Foundation" → "Grove AI Foundation"
- Fixed terminal reference: "the-grove.ai" → Terminal interface
- Replaced "users" with "Observers" in agent-facing contexts, "Gardeners" in product contexts
- Strengthened voice consistency: removed some hedging in claims while preserving intentional uncertainty in risk assessments
- Clarified current vs. legacy positioning references
- Maintained all substantive risk discussions and caveats (these are intentionally honest)

### Flags for Review
- Document extensively covers psychological risks of engagement - confirm this level of transparency aligns with current communication strategy
- References specific tragic AI chatbot incidents - verify appropriateness for inclusion
- Technical constraint discussions are detailed - ensure alignment with current capability messaging
