## Rewrite: 260100-s-arch-bedrock-information-architecture.md
### Diagnosis Summary
The source document is well-structured and current, with strong architectural thinking. Main issues are scattered legacy terminology ("Grove Foundation platform" vs "Grove"), some corporate phrasing, and minor inconsistencies with current positioning around exploration architecture.

### Key Changes Made
- Fixed terminology: "Grove Foundation platform" → "Grove", "users" → "Observers/Gardeners"
- Strengthened opening with exploration architecture positioning
- Removed corporate phrasing ("deliver unprecedented value" tone)
- Aligned metaphor explanations with current strategic framing
- Clarified that this is infrastructure for discovery, not productivity
- Preserved all technical specifications and architectural decisions
- Maintained the excellent horticultural metaphor consistency

### Flags for Review
- None - document was already well-aligned with checkpoint and methodology
