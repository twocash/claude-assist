## Rewrite: 251222-s-arch-documentation-refactoring-sprint.md
### Diagnosis Summary
This is a technical sprint completion report from December 2024, documenting the refactoring of Grove's architecture documentation to support the Field system. The content is primarily factual/technical with minimal strategic positioning, but uses some legacy terminology that needs updating.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated "Tokens" → "Credits" in attribution context
- Replaced "DEX stack" with clearer "Trellis Architecture layers"
- Removed crypto-adjacent language ("federation" → "distributed operation")
- Added Grove-specific context to technical descriptions
- Maintained all technical specifications and implementation details intact

### Flags for Review
- Document references internal GUIDs and file structures that may need verification
- Sprint numbering system (Sprint 6, Phase 2, etc.) preserved but may need current context
- Implementation timeline references may be outdated
