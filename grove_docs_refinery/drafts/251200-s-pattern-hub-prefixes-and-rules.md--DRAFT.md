### Diagnosis Summary
This document contains detailed prompt instructions for writing a Grove white paper, but uses legacy terminology and framing. It references outdated positioning ("distributed intelligence," "automata") and contains overly complex multi-prompt architecture that doesn't align with current streamlined approach.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated "Infrastructure for the Age of Automata" to "Exploration Architecture for Discovery"
- Replaced "distributed intelligence" with "distributed AI infrastructure"
- Simplified the multi-prompt structure into clearer sections
- Updated terminology: "automata" → "agents," "tokens" → "credits"
- Aligned strategic framing with current positioning
- Removed unnecessarily complex citation hierarchy instructions
- Streamlined voice guidance to match current standards

### Flags for Review
- The multi-prompt architecture may need complete restructuring for current workflow
- Some technical references may need updating against current checkpoint documents
- Voice examples should be validated against latest Grove content standards
