## Rewrite: 251200-v-engage-knowledge-commons-deep-dive.md
### Diagnosis Summary
The source document is well-structured with solid research foundation, but uses legacy terminology ("The-Grove.ai Foundation" vs "Foundation", "Worldsmiths" vs current agent roles) and frames Grove as platform rather than exploration architecture. The content is academically strong but needs voice tightening and positioning alignment.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology: "The-Grove.ai Foundation" → "Foundation", "Worldsmiths" → "Observers"
- Strengthened opening with exploration architecture framing
- Activated passive voice throughout
- Removed throat-clearing phrases ("It's important to note")
- Updated strategic positioning to emphasize discovery over optimization
- Maintained all substantive research citations and academic rigor
- Preserved intentional caveats about design tensions and tradeoffs

### Flags for Review
- Kept "Worldsmiths" term in context where human oversight is discussed - may need clarification on current role terminology
- Maintained detailed research citations - confirm these align with current reference priorities
