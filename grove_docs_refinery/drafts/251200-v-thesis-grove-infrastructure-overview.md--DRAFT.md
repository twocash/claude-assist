## Rewrite: 251200-v-thesis-grove-infrastructure-overview.md
### Diagnosis Summary
This document reflects strong strategic thinking but contains legacy terminology and positioning inconsistencies. The core thesis about The Ratchet and distributed architecture is sound, but needs alignment with current Grove positioning as "exploration architecture" rather than generic "distributed AI."

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology (Tokens→Credits, Users→Observers/Gardeners, etc.)
- Aligned framing with "exploration architecture" positioning
- Removed buzzwords like "world-changing" and crypto-adjacent language
- Strengthened voice consistency and removed throat-clearing
- Preserved all intentional caveats and honest assessments
- Updated technical descriptions to match current hybrid architecture

### Flags for Review
- None - document aligns well with checkpoint once terminology is corrected
