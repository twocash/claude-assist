### Diagnosis Summary
This document contains Grove's early conceptual vision but suffers from legacy positioning ("distributed intelligence network," "AI civilizations," "gaming" framing) and terminology misalignment. The content is substantive but needs realignment with current exploration architecture positioning and terminology standards.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated framing from "distributed intelligence network" to "exploration architecture"
- Replaced "Gardeners" with "Observers" in agent-facing contexts
- Changed "tokens" to "credits" throughout
- Shifted from gaming/entertainment positioning to infrastructure/discovery focus
- Updated economic model terminology (inefficiency tax → efficiency tax)
- Aligned technical architecture with current hybrid approach
- Preserved honest assessment sections about risks and open questions

### Flags for Review
- Economic model details may need validation against current implementation
- Roadmap timeline assumptions should be verified
- Some gaming metaphors retained where they serve the explanation effectively
