## Rewrite: 251200-s-arch-trellis-first-order-directives-v2.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document presents the core architectural principles but uses legacy terminology ("Villagers/Agents," TCP/IP metaphor) and needs alignment with current strategic framing. The philosophical foundation is strong but requires updating to reflect current Grove positioning and terminology.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology mappings (Villagers→Agents, DEX Stack→Trellis Architecture principles)
- Strengthened exploration architecture framing vs. generic AI positioning
- Removed TCP/IP metaphor (too infrastructure-focused, not exploration-focused)
- Clarified Field-scoping as architectural necessity, not just organization
- Updated references to match current document structure
- Preserved core philosophical insights about models vs. architecture

### Flags for Review
- Verified all terminology matches current checkpoint
- Maintained technical precision while improving accessibility
- Kept "Living Constitution" framing as it reflects Grove's evolutionary approach
