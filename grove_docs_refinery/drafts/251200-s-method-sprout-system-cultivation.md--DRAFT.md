## Rewrite: 251200-s-method-sprout-system-cultivation.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document presents solid conceptual architecture but uses legacy terminology ("Knowledge Commons" vs current "Knowledge Commons"), generic "collective intelligence" framing vs Grove's specific "exploration architecture," and academic positioning that doesn't align with current university consortium strategy.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated framing from "collective intelligence cultivation" to "exploration architecture capture mechanism"
- Replaced "LLM interface" with "agents" throughout
- Aligned terminology: "Knowledge Commons" → consistent usage, "Fields" → maintained as architectural term
- Strengthened connection to Grove's core thesis about infrastructure over capabilities
- Removed buzzwords ("unprecedented," generic AI references)
- Updated positioning to reflect university partnership focus
- Clarified MVP scope to match current Terminal capabilities

### Flags for Review
- Document assumes multi-Field architecture but MVP is single-Field (Grove Foundation only) - verified this is accurate
- "Protocol perspective" section implies broader adoption strategy - aligns with current positioning
- Research questions section maintains academic tone which fits university audience

# The Sprout System: Capturing Value in Exploration Architecture

*Conceptual Architecture for University Partners*

**Version:** 2.0  
**Status:** Draft for Academic Review  
**Date:** December 2024

## Abstract

The Sprout System transforms ephemeral agent interactions into persistent knowledge artifacts. Users capture valuable agent outputs within bounded Fields (knowledge domains), creating a recursive loop where captured insights improve future explorations. This document outlines the conceptual flow, distinguishes current Terminal capabilities from roadmap features, and positions the architecture as infrastructure for academic exploration rather than productivity optimization.
