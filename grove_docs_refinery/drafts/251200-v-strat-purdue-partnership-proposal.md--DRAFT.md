### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is recent (December 2025) and mostly aligned with current positioning. Strong strategic argument but contains some legacy framing around "distributed AI" and needs terminology updates. The honest assessment of political risks and institutional traps should be preserved as intentional strategic analysis.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated "distributed AI" to "distributed AI infrastructure" throughout
- Replaced "platform" with "architecture" where appropriate
- Added "exploration architecture" framing in key positioning
- Strengthened Grove-specific terminology (Terminal, Foundation, etc.)
- Tightened prose by removing hedging filler while preserving substantive caveats
- Updated financial reference to reflect Credits terminology in context
- Enhanced opening to lead with core strategic insight

### Flags for Review
- Political scenario section contains intentional hedging ("Perhaps not") - preserved as strategic honesty
- Resource requirements may need updating based on current operational costs
- Timeline references (Q1 2026) may need adjustment based on actual launch schedule
