## Rewrite: 251230-s-exec-bedrock-sprint-contract-v1.0.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is current (December 2025) and well-structured. Primary issues: uses legacy terminology ("Foundation Loop" vs current architecture), lacks Grove's strategic framing, and could benefit from clearer connection to exploration architecture goals.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology: "Foundation Loop" → "Grove development methodology"
- Added exploration architecture framing to connect contract to strategic purpose
- Replaced generic "AI assistance" with "agent-based exploration support"
- Clarified that Bedrock implements Trellis Architecture (Grove's reference implementation)
- Maintained all technical requirements and enforcement mechanisms
- Preserved all intentional precision and constraint language

### Flags for Review
- Contract enforcement mechanisms assume specific team structure - may need adjustment for current Grove Foundation structure
- File location references may need verification against actual repository structure
