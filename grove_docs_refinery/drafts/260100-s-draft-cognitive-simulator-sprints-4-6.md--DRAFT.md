## Rewrite: 260100-s-draft-cognitive-simulator-sprints-4-6.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is well-aligned with current positioning but contains legacy terminology ("tokens" → "credits") and some architectural outdated framing. The honest assessment of constraints and risks should be preserved as intentional intellectual honesty.

### Key Changes Made
- Fixed terminology mapping (tokens → credits, users → observers/gardeners)
- Updated positioning from "hybrid intelligence" to "exploration architecture"
- Aligned with current three-layer architecture terminology
- Preserved technical constraints and risk sections (intentional honesty)
- Strengthened Grove's differentiation claims
- Removed buzzword language while maintaining technical precision

### Flags for Review
- Technical implementation details are preserved as-is (outside editorial scope)
- Resource economics metaphor strengthened to align with current credit system framing

# The Cognitive Simulator: From Entropy Detection to Distributed Cognition

## A Development Narrative for Grove Terminal Phase 2

**Document Purpose:** This narrative captures the intellectual architecture behind the Cognitive Simulator implementation—not just the what and how, but the *why*. It documents our thinking for future reference and ensures the sprint execution aligns with Grove's exploration architecture and knowledge sharing vision.

**Status:** Active Development

**Sprint Cycle:** 4-6 (December 2025 - January 2026)
