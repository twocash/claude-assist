### Diagnosis Summary
Source document from December 2025 reflects strong architectural thinking but uses some legacy terminology and verbose corporate framing. Core insights about research as knowledge growth mechanism are sound and align well with current positioning.

### Key Changes Made
- Replaced "tokens" with "credits" throughout
- Simplified executive summary to lead with core insight
- Strengthened competitive positioning around exploration vs optimization
- Removed throat-clearing phrases like "It's important to note"
- Activated passive constructions and tightened prose
- Maintained all technical specifications and honest risk assessments

### Flags for Review
- Cost estimates in appendix may need updating for current credit economics
- RAG architecture assumptions should align with current vector store decisions
