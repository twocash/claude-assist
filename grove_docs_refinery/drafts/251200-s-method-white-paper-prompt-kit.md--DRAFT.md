## Rewrite: 251200-s-method-white-paper-prompt-kit.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is well-structured but contains legacy terminology ("potentially," hedging language) and needs alignment with current Grove positioning as exploration architecture. The planner-executor methodology is sound and should be preserved.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology mappings (tokens→Credits, users→Observers/Gardeners)
- Replaced "distributed AI systems" framing with "exploration architecture"
- Strengthened voice guidelines to match current Grove standards
- Updated technical constraints to reflect hybrid architecture reality
- Aligned advisor priority rankings with current council status
- Removed hedging language while preserving intentional uncertainty sections

### Flags for Review
- Advisory council priority rankings may need verification with current engagement levels
- Technical constraint descriptions assume current hybrid architecture approach
