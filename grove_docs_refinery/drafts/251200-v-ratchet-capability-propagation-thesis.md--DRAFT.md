### Diagnosis Summary
Source content is relatively current (reflects Grove's architectural positioning and ratchet thesis) but contains some legacy framing around "moats" and needs terminology updates. The strategic argument is sound and aligns with current positioning.

### Key Changes Made
- Replaced "The Grove" with "Grove" throughout for consistency
- Updated "AI" to "distributed AI infrastructure" where appropriate for positioning clarity
- Removed "moat" language (prohibited buzzword) and reframed competitive advantage discussion
- Strengthened opening with more concrete framing
- Enhanced the infrastructure vs. capability distinction
- Clarified the efficiency tax mechanism using current checkpoint language
- Tightened prose throughout while preserving core argument structure

### Flags for Review
- The efficiency tax explanation could use validation against current economic model
- "Smart money" framing is bold but appropriate for strategic positioning

# The Ratchet Thesis

## Thesis: The Infrastructure Bet vs. The Capability Bet

Three hundred billion dollars in announced AI data center investments share one assumption: whoever controls the frontier controls AI. Build more capacity. Hoard more GPUs. Innovate faster. Stay ahead.

This bet has a fundamental problem. AI capability propagates.

What required frontier-scale compute last year runs on laptops this year. The pattern holds with startling consistency—task completion capability doubles every seven months. Today's miracle becomes tomorrow's commodity.

The consolidation play isn't building durable infrastructure. It's building a treadmill.
