## Rewrite: 251200-v-engage-terminal-deep-dive.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Strong foundational content with good research grounding and structural logic. Main issues: inconsistent terminology (uses "villages" vs current "communities"), some hedging language that dilutes claims, and positioning that emphasizes simulation-to-service transition rather than current exploration architecture framing.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology: "villages" → "agent communities," "Gardener" → "Observer," "white paper" → "architectural documents"
- Strengthened opening positioning to emphasize exploration architecture over utility-first framing
- Removed hedging language while preserving intentional caveats in constraints section
- Updated references to align with current Grove positioning (Foundation vs organization references)
- Clarified hybrid architecture as bridge to local-first, not permanent solution

### Flags for Review
- Maintained research citations as-is (assume they're accurate to source material)
- Preserved "Honest Constraints" section hedging language as intentionally cautious
- Some technical implementation details may need validation against current Terminal state
