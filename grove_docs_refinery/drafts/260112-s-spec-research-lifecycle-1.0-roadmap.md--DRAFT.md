### Diagnosis Summary
Strong technical roadmap with clear architectural insights and specific implementation plan. Terminology needs updating (tokens→credits, etc.) and some hedging language can be tightened. The core "configuration IS the agent" insight is solid and should be preserved.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology mappings (tokens→credits, users→Observers, etc.)
- Strengthened voice by removing hedging language
- Aligned positioning with "exploration architecture" framing
- Preserved technical precision and architectural insights
- Maintained honest assessment of current limitations

### Flags for Review
- Technical architecture details align with current Trellis Architecture spec
- Sprint timeline assumes current team capacity - may need adjustment
- "Knowledge Base" terminology might need alignment with "Knowledge Commons"
