### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is recent (December 2025) and technically focused, written for implementation teams. Contains some legacy terminology ("DEX" vs current "Grove") and could strengthen voice consistency. Structure and technical content are solid.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology: "DEX Stack" → "Grove Architecture", "DEX Objects" → "Grove Objects"
- Strengthened voice by removing hedging and passive constructions
- Clarified the strangler fig pattern explanation
- Made compliance tests more direct and actionable
- Preserved all technical specifications and architectural decisions

### Flags for Review
- All architectural decisions and implementation patterns maintained as specified
- Technical accuracy preserved throughout
