## Rewrite: 251200-v-engage-journal-system-architecture.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Legacy document with strong research foundation but outdated terminology ("Journal" vs "Diary") and positioning. Contains valuable psychological research synthesis but needs alignment with current exploration architecture framing and Grove voice standards.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated "Journal System" to "Diary System" throughout (current terminology)
- Replaced "Observers" with "The Observer" for consistency
- Strengthened exploration architecture positioning vs generic AI platform framing
- Removed throat-clearing phrases and corporate language
- Activated passive constructions and tightened prose
- Maintained research citations and honest assessment sections
- Updated copyright to reflect Grove AI Foundation naming

### Flags for Review
- Research citations are from 2024-2025 and appear current - validated against checkpoint
- Ethical considerations section maintains intentional hedging about risks (preserved as designed)
- Technical claims about 7B parameter constraints align with current positioning
