## Rewrite: 251200-s-arch-technical-architecture-reference.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source is comprehensive technical reference from 2025 with solid architecture detail. Contains some legacy framing and needs terminology alignment with current checkpoint. Strong on technical specifics but could better reflect exploration architecture positioning.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated core framing to "exploration architecture" rather than generic "distributed AI workforce"
- Fixed terminology: Tokens→Credits, Users→Observers, platform→architecture
- Aligned with current hybrid architecture understanding (local routine + cloud pivotal)
- Strengthened The Ratchet positioning and capability timeline
- Enhanced Journal system description to match current emphasis
- Removed some crypto-adjacent language around economics
- Maintained technical accuracy while improving strategic positioning

### Flags for Review
- Economics section simplified but may need review against latest credit system design
- Hardware requirements maintained as-is but could benefit from validation against current Terminal specs
- Network architecture phases may need updating based on current roadmap priorities

# Grove Technical Architecture Reference

**Document Purpose:** This is the authoritative technical reference for Grove architecture. Any technical specification requests should be grounded in this document, NOT interpolated from generic edge computing or IoT patterns.

**Critical Distinction:** Grove is NOT an IoT sensor network, NOT a Raspberry Pi edge computing system, and NOT a generic AI inference endpoint. Grove is exploration architecture—infrastructure for how humans and AI discover ideas together.
