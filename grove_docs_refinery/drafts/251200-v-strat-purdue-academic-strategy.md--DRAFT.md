### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is strategically sound but uses legacy terminology and lacks alignment with current Grove positioning as exploration architecture. The tactical university navigation advice is excellent and should be preserved.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology (Grove Project → Grove exploration architecture)
- Aligned with current positioning (distributed AI infrastructure for exploration)
- Strengthened framing around epistemic independence
- Added specific references to Dr. Chiang's background and Big Tech critique
- Clarified Wayne Turner's role and background
- Removed generic "AI systems" language for more precise Grove terminology

### Flags for Review
- University messaging strategy may need coordination with Wayne Turner's actual approach
- The "donations from tech partners" framing might conflict with epistemic independence positioning

# Purdue: Academic Strategy

# **The Academic Power Map**

Universities have predictable power structures, and knowing who controls what determines your approach:

**The Board of Trustees** sets strategic priorities and approves major initiatives, but they don't originate ideas — they bless them. A trustee like Wayne Turner can't unilaterally push something through; he can champion it, ask strategic questions that signal interest, and connect you to the right internal people. His value is credibility and access, not direct authority. Turner brings litigation experience and understands institutional decision-making.

**The President** (Dr. Mung Chiang at Purdue) is the key decision-maker for anything that touches institutional strategy. Chiang is a network theorist by training with a track record of criticizing Big Tech concentration — exactly the right background for Grove's epistemic independence thesis. But presidents protect their time — you need a warm introduction or compelling strategic rationale for engagement.

**The VP of Research** (currently Theresa Mayer at Purdue) is often the right operational entry point. This role controls research strategy, manages large grant relationships, and oversees research centers. If Grove can be framed as exploration infrastructure with external funding potential, this is the door.

**The Deans** — specifically the Dean of the College of Science and the Dean of Engineering — have their own strategic plans and need to see clear alignment. Computer Science sits under Science at Purdue.

**Corporate and Foundation Relations** handles major partnerships. If you're discussing support from technology companies for epistemic independence infrastructure, this office structures those relationships.

**How Wayne Turner Would Work This**

The realistic path:

1. **Private conversation with you** to understand the vision and his role (the podcast is preparation for this)
2. **Informal socialization** — Turner mentions it to President Chiang or the Provost at a board event: "I've been examining something significant in distributed AI infrastructure. There's a local angle with an Indianapolis company building alternatives to Big Tech concentration. Worth exploring?" This plants a seed without requiring commitment.
3. **Connect you to the VP of Research or relevant Dean** — Turner's introduction gets you a substantive meeting. You pitch Grove as: exploration architecture for research institutions, infrastructure for epistemic independence, potential for external support, and talent pipeline for Indiana's tech corridor.
4. **Exploratory committee or working group** — if there's interest, the university forms a small evaluation group covering: intellectual property implications, resource requirements, fit with existing research priorities. This is where momentum builds or dies.
5. **Board briefing** — if internal champions emerge, it comes to the board as an information item or seed support request. Turner's prior socialization makes this smoother.

**What Makes This Attractive to Purdue Specifically**

Purdue's positioning aligns with Grove's thesis:

- **Dr. Chiang's background** — Network theorist, former Princeton faculty, vocal Big Tech critic. Distributed infrastructure and AI architecture are in his wheelhouse. His public statements about technology concentration support Grove's epistemic independence frame.
- **The Hard Tech Corridor** — Purdue champions Indiana as "Silicon Crossroads." An Indianapolis-based company with Purdue research ties fits that narrative perfectly.
- **Defense connections** — Purdue has deep DOD relationships. The geopolitical angle (not concentrating AI in corporate hands, building distributed compute resilience) resonates with defense-adjacent research interests.
- **Being the "Berkeley of exploration"** — Purdue lacks an iconic open-source infrastructure project. Grove could fill that gap.

**How the School Would Frame This**

If it works, here's the university communications approach:

> "Purdue leads new research initiative in exploration architecture — partnering with industry to build open infrastructure for discovery. Grove's distributed AI architecture, with research partnerships at Purdue, creates both a research hub and talent pipeline for Indiana's growing tech sector while preserving academic independence from Big Tech gatekeepers."

That's the press release. It emphasizes leadership, openness, economic development, and institutional sovereignty — not the fascinating details of agent communities developing emergent cultures.

**Strategic Context**

This approach positions Grove as infrastructure that universities need rather than technology they might want. The frame is epistemic independence: research institutions face a choice between depending on corporate AI gatekeepers or building sovereign exploration infrastructure. Grove is that infrastructure.

Dr. Chiang's background and public positions on technology concentration make him a natural champion for this thesis. Wayne Turner's experience and trustee position provide the access and credibility needed for serious consideration.

The goal isn't just Purdue adoption — it's Purdue as anchor for a university consortium that demonstrates viable alternatives to Big Tech dependence.
