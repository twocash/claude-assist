## Rewrite: 251200-v-econ-economics-deep-dive.md
### Diagnosis Summary
This document is well-aligned with current positioning but contains some legacy terminology and could strengthen the exploration architecture framing. The intentional hedging in risk sections should be preserved as it demonstrates intellectual honesty about unproven mechanisms.

### Key Changes Made
- Fixed terminology: "tokens" → "credits," "users" → "gardeners" and "Observers"
- Strengthened exploration architecture positioning vs. generic platform economics
- Updated Foundation references to current naming convention
- Clarified hybrid architecture implications for compute costs
- Preserved all intentional uncertainty language in risk sections

### Flags for Review
- Economic parameters table may need validation against current implementation
- References to "villages" vs. current community terminology - confirmed this is accurate per architectural docs
