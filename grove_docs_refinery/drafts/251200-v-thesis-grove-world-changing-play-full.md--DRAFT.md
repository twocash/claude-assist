### Diagnosis Summary
Source document is comprehensive but contains legacy terminology (tokens→credits), scattered hedging language that weakens arguments, and some positioning that predates current strategic frame around "exploration architecture." Strong content overall but needs terminology alignment and voice tightening.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology throughout (tokens→credits, platform→architecture, etc.)
- Replaced "distributed AI" framing with "exploration architecture" positioning
- Removed filler hedging while preserving intentional uncertainty in honest assessment sections
- Strengthened voice from passive to active constructions
- Aligned economic model language with current efficiency-enlightenment loop framing
- Updated Foundation role to match current governance transition mechanisms

### Flags for Review
- Economic projections in Section 6 may need updating based on current market conditions
- Timeline estimates in roadmap assume development resources that may need validation
- Some technical constraints may have evolved since document creation
