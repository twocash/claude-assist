## Rewrite: 251200-v-econ-reverse-progressive-tax-model.md
### Diagnosis Summary
Source document from December 2025 contains strong analytical framework but uses legacy terminology ("tokens" → "credits") and could benefit from clearer Grove-specific positioning and more direct voice.

### Key Changes Made
- Updated terminology: "tokens" → "credits", "users" → "observers/gardeners"
- Clarified Grove's exploration architecture positioning vs. generic distributed AI
- Strengthened voice by removing hedging language and throat-clearing
- Added concrete Grove context (Terminal, agents, diary systems)
- Preserved all technical analysis, risk assessment, and honest caveats
- Simplified executive summary language for accessibility

### Flags for Review
- Economic model parameters may need validation against current Terminal metrics
- "Reverse progressive tax" framing - confirm this remains the preferred terminology
