## Rewrite: 251200-v-research-functiongemma-validates-hybrid-theory.md
### Diagnosis Summary
This December 2025 technical strategy document validates Grove's Ratchet thesis using Google's FunctionGemma release as evidence. The document is well-structured and technically sound but contains legacy terminology (particularly "tokens" for Grove's internal economy) and some unnecessarily complex phrasing that could be simplified.

### Key Changes Made
- Fixed terminology: "tokens" → "credits" throughout
- Simplified dense academic phrasing while preserving technical precision
- Updated strategic positioning to emphasize exploration architecture
- Strengthened voice consistency and removed some hedging language
- Preserved all technical analysis and honest assessments of tradeoffs

### Flags for Review
- Document makes strong claims about partnership potential with Google - should verify this aligns with current business development strategy
- Three-tier architecture proposal represents significant technical direction change - may need architectural review
