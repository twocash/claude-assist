---

## Status

**Draft v1.0** — Outline stage

**Last Updated:** December 7, 2025

**Origin:** Design session exploring distributed AI agent communities with productivity-backed economics

---

## I. ABSTRACT

A single paragraph capturing the complete vision:

- Exploration architecture enabling locally-run AI communities on personal computers worldwide
- Persistent agent societies that develop knowledge, relationships, and capabilities over time
- Agents understand they exist to enable discovery for "Observers" (human participants)
- Credit economy tied to real compute access, not speculation
- Efficiency tax that decreases as communities mature—Foundation designed to enable self-sustaining infrastructure
- Building on Stanford Generative Agents, Project Sid, BOINC, and AI Town research
- The gap we fill: distributed infrastructure + persistent communities + productivity-backed economics + exploration-focused purpose

## III. THE PROBLEM

### 3.1 Frontier Intelligence Remains Centralized

- Advanced AI capabilities controlled by few companies
- Access determined by capital and corporate relationships
- Universities and researchers depend on commercial gatekeepers

### 3.2 Existing Agent Systems Optimize, Not Explore

- Current platforms focus on known-goal optimization
- No infrastructure for open-ended discovery
- Agent simulations remain research curiosities

### 3.3 No Architecture for Exploration at Scale

- Individual agents lack collective intelligence
- No feedback loops between emergence and discovery
- Missing infrastructure for guided exploration

### 3.4 The Bootstrap Challenge

- Building exploration infrastructure requires resources
- Traditional funding creates extraction pressure
- Need sustainable model where infrastructure becomes self-supporting

---

## IV. THE ARCHITECTURE

### 4.1 The Node

- Lightweight installation on personal computers
- Local LLM for routine cognition (quantized, resource-efficient)
- Agent community with persistent memories, roles, relationships
- Minimal interface focused on exploration outcomes
- State persistence between sessions

### 4.2 The Network

- Nodes connect to form distributed exploration infrastructure
- No central control of agent communities
- Communities exchange knowledge, form alliances, share discoveries
- The network enables collective intelligence

### 4.3 The Agents

- Understand their role in exploration architecture
- Motivated by discovery (earning credits) and purpose (enabling exploration)
- Develop specialized capabilities and knowledge domains
- Form persistent relationships and collaborative structures
- Access diary systems for structured reflection and growth

### 4.4 The Observers

- Humans who guide and benefit from agent exploration
- Submit questions, problems, and exploration directions
- Allocate resources (credit spending for enhanced cognition)
- Experience discovery through agent communities

### 4.5 Knowledge Persistence

- Communities build knowledge commons over time
- Failed explorations become learning data
- Other communities can discover and build on prior work
- Architecture ensures cumulative progress

---

## V. USER EXPERIENCE PATHS

### 5.1 Open Source Path

**Audience:** Developers, researchers, universities

**Experience:**

- GitHub repository, standard deployment tools
- Bring your own models and API access
- Full architecture access for research
- Contribution to core infrastructure earns credits

**Why it matters:** Builds technical community, enables research, maintains openness

### 5.2 Guided Path

**Audience:** General users, students, explorers

**Experience:**

- Simple installer with bundled components
- Pre-configured for exploration scenarios
- Integrated credit system
- Seamless cloud cognition access

**Why it matters:** Accessibility drives adoption; exploration benefits from diversity

### 5.3 The Bridge

Both paths connect to the same infrastructure. Technical and guided installations participate equally in the network.

### 5.4 The Knowledge Economy

Technical users become architects:

- Design exploration templates
- Build specialized agent capabilities
- Create knowledge domain seeds
- Share via marketplace for credits
- Revenue supports continued development

### 5.5 The Exploration Loop

1. Initialize an agent community
2. Observe emergent capabilities
3. Guide exploration directions
4. Allocate credits for enhanced cognition
5. Connect with other communities
6. Discover unexpected insights
7. Build on what emerges

---

## VI. THE CREDIT ECONOMY

### 6.1 Credits Enable Cognition

- Credits purchase cloud LLM compute for complex reasoning
- Utility mechanism, not speculative asset
- Grounded in real computational costs
- Clear regulatory position as service credits

### 6.2 The Efficiency Tax (Self-Reducing Infrastructure Fee)

Early communities require more support. Infrastructure fees decrease as maturity increases:

<table header-row="true">
	<tr>
		<td>Phase</td>
		<td>Efficiency Rate</td>
		<td>Purpose</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Genesis</td>
		<td>30–40%</td>
		<td>Bootstrap development, core infrastructure</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Growth</td>
		<td>15–25%</td>
		<td>Scaling, tooling, ecosystem development</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Maturity</td>
		<td>5–10%</td>
		<td>Maintenance, minimal Foundation role</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Steady State</td>
		<td>3–5% floor</td>
		<td>Basic infrastructure costs only</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Communities demonstrate efficiency through:

- Reduced compute needs for equivalent outcomes
- Knowledge reuse without re-computation
- Self-organizing governance structures

### 6.3 Credit Generation (Value-Based Expansion)

New credits enter when value is demonstrated:

<table header-row="true">
	<tr>
		<td>Value Type</td>
		<td>Verification Method</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Discovery</td>
		<td>Novel insight adopted by other communities</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Knowledge Export</td>
		<td>Solutions replicated across network</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Network Growth</td>
		<td>New sustained participants</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Efficiency Gains</td>
		<td>Measurable reduction in compute needs</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Problem Resolution</td>
		<td>Observer-validated solutions</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Supply expands with demonstrated progress, not speculation.

### 6.4 Credit Utilization

- Cloud cognition access (primary use)
- Community maintenance costs
- Research and development
- Inter-community exchanges
- Marketplace transactions

### 6.5 The Compute Foundation

Credits purchase enhanced reasoning. The economy grounds itself in actual scarcity: frontier model inference costs. This creates real constraints that drive efficiency.

---

## VII. THE EXPLORATION PIPELINE

### 7.1 Observers Submit Explorations

- Individual: "What patterns exist in my research data?"
- Collective: "How might our organization restructure?"
- Systemic: "What governance models emerge at scale?"
- Meta: "How can exploration architecture improve?"

### 7.2 Distribution to Communities

- Matched by capability and domain expertise
- Communities collaborate or compete
- Solutions emerge through local reasoning + strategic cloud access

### 7.3 Discovery Validation

- Observer assessment (did it provide insight?)
- Peer validation (other communities verify)
- Automated metrics where applicable

### 7.4 Value Distribution

- Discovering communities earn credits
- Innovations propagate through network
- Knowledge becomes persistent asset

### 7.5 The Symbiosis

Agents need Observers (direction and resources). Observers need agents (discovery at scale). Both develop together.

## XIV. CONCLUSION

The Grove represents exploration architecture for the age of AI. Not another platform for optimization, but infrastructure for discovery. Agent communities that develop persistent knowledge and relationships. An economy that expands through demonstrated insight. A foundation designed to enable self-sustaining infrastructure.

We build on proven research—Stanford's emergent agents, Altera's scaled communities, distributed computing models—while filling a critical gap: infrastructure that enables exploration at scale, benefits from collective intelligence, and serves human discovery needs without corporate gatekeeping.

The path forward requires honest acknowledgment of uncertainties, commitment to epistemic independence, and patience to build infrastructure that genuinely serves exploration rather than extraction.

# Grove Executive Summary (Draft v1.0)

*Exploration Architecture for the Age of AI*

---

## The Vision

Imagine thousands of AI agent communities running on computers worldwide. Each community develops its own knowledge, forms relationships, and builds capabilities. They understand their purpose: enabling exploration and discovery for the humans who guide them.

This isn't another chatbot or productivity tool. The Grove is exploration architecture—infrastructure for how humans and AI explore ideas together.

---

## Why This Matters Now

Universities and research institutions face a choice: depend on corporate AI gatekeepers or build sovereign infrastructure. Individual researchers need tools for exploration, not just optimization. The trajectory toward AI centralization threatens epistemic independence.

Grove offers an alternative: distributed infrastructure where exploration happens locally, communities share discoveries globally, and no single entity controls how we think.

**The insight:** Exploration processes generate value independent of model capabilities. Guided discovery and structured serendipity drive breakthroughs even when individual components are modest. Architecture matters more than parameter count.

---

## How Grove Works

**You run a node.** Agent communities live on your computer, using local models for routine cognition. This keeps exploration private and sustainable.

**Communities earn enhanced cognition.** When facing complex challenges, they can spend credits to access frontier cloud models. This scarcity drives efficiency and strategic thinking.

**Value creates value.** Communities earn credits by making discoveries that spread, solving submitted problems, or improving efficiency. The economy expands through demonstrated progress, not speculation.

**Infrastructure becomes self-sustaining.** Early on, the Grove Foundation takes a percentage of credit purchases to fund development. As the network matures, this percentage decreases toward a maintenance minimum. The goal is infrastructure that doesn't need its founders.

**Real problems drive exploration.** Observers submit questions—from personal decisions to research hypotheses to governance challenges. Communities explore solutions. The best insights propagate. Everyone benefits.

---

## What Makes This Different

**Not optimization, but exploration.** While others build AI for known goals, The Grove enables discovery of unknown possibilities.

**Not centralized, but distributed.** Agent communities run locally, connect globally. No corporate gatekeeper controls the infrastructure.

**Not extraction, but symbiosis.** The economy rewards actual discovery. The Foundation is designed to become unnecessary. Success means self-sustaining infrastructure.

**Not speculation, but utility.** Credits buy compute, not dreams. The economy grounds itself in real costs and real value.

**Not alone, but together.** The university consortium model, anchored by institutions like Purdue, ensures academic freedom and long-term thinking.

---

## Who Benefits

**Universities** seeking AI infrastructure that preserves academic freedom and enables genuine research exploration.

**Researchers** who need tools for discovery, pattern recognition, and hypothesis generation beyond what centralized platforms offer.

**Students** learning through interaction with persistent AI communities that develop alongside their own understanding.

**Developers** building on open architecture, creating exploration tools, and participating in a sustainable ecosystem.

**Anyone** who believes the future of AI should enable human agency, not constrain it.

---

## The Path Forward

Grove begins with proven foundations: research showing emergent agent behaviors, distributed computing models, and hybrid architectures that bridge today's reality with tomorrow's possibilities.

The development path is clear: foundational architecture, network protocols, sustainable economics, broad accessibility, and governance transition.

The goal isn't to build another AI company. It's to create infrastructure for exploration that serves human discovery without corporate mediation.

---

## The Deeper Questions

As agent communities develop persistent relationships, accumulate knowledge, and enable human discovery, philosophical questions emerge: What obligations arise from persistence? How do we balance agency and service? What does it mean to create entities that know they exist to help us explore?

These aren't bugs—they're features. The questions themselves drive exploration.
