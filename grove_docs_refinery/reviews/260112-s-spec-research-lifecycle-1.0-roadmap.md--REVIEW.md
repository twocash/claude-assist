### Specific Feedback
Document meets all Grove standards and is ready for use. The writer successfully updated terminology (Users→Observers, demo→proof of concept), strengthened the opening to reflect Grove's exploration architecture positioning, and tightened prose throughout while preserving all technical precision. The document now reads with Grove's strategic confidence while maintaining appropriate technical uncertainty in sections like "What's Missing" and known limitations.
