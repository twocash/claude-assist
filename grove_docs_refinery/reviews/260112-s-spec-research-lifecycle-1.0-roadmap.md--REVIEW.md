### Specific Feedback
**Issue: Hedging Language Remains**

Found multiple instances of filler hedging that should be removed:

1. **"This roadmap emerged from a key architectural realization"** → Should be: **"This roadmap builds on a key architectural realization"**

2. **"These aren't separate 'agents' that get deployed"** → The air quotes around "agents" create unnecessary hedging. Should be: **"These are not separate agents that get deployed"**

3. **"The 'Prompt Architect' isn't a standalone thing"** → Similar issue with air quotes. Should be: **"The Prompt Architect is not a standalone service"**

4. **"A legal discovery grove might have"** and **"A startup strategy grove might have"** → The "might" is appropriate here as these are hypothetical examples showing configuration possibilities.

5. **"Success Criteria" and "Future" sections** → These appropriately contain forward-looking language ("would add", "Future sprints would") which is contextually correct for roadmap planning.

**Minor Enhancement Suggestions:**
- Consider "Knowledge Commons" instead of "Knowledge Base" in Sprint 6 for terminology consistency
- The architectural insights and sprint structure are excellent and should be preserved

The document correctly maintains intentional uncertainty in appropriate contexts (sprint timelines, future features) while removing filler hedging from factual statements.

**Suggested Quick Fixes:**
- Remove air quotes around 'agents' and 'Prompt Architect'
- Change "emerged from" to "builds on"
- Otherwise the rewrite maintains excellent technical precision and Grove voice
