### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a strong analytical document into compelling Grove content. Key improvements:

**Strategic Positioning**: The opening now leads with Grove's core insight rather than burying it. "Exploration architecture" framing is consistent throughout.

**Terminology Updates**: Properly maps legacy terms to current vocabulary while preserving technical precision. The writer correctly retained "efficiency tax" in specific contexts where it functions as a defined economic mechanism.

**Voice Consistency**: Achieves the target Grove voice—confident without overselling, concrete over abstract, accessible yet sophisticated. The prose is significantly tighter while preserving analytical rigor.

**Intentional Honesty Preserved**: The "Honest Assessment: Sensitivity Analysis" section correctly maintains hedging language like "might," "could," and explicit uncertainty statements. This is substantive intellectual honesty about model limitations, not filler throat-clearing.

**Technical Accuracy**: All quantitative models and claims remain intact and properly sourced.
