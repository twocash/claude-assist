### Assessment: REVISE

### Validation Checklist
- [x] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned
- [x] Technical accuracy
- [x] Voice consistency
- [x] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [ ] Changes justified
- [ ] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**Issue: Incomplete rewrite**

The writer provided only a diagnosis and change summary but did not deliver the actual rewritten content. The review cannot be completed without the full rewritten document.

**Required for resubmission:**
- Complete rewritten document with all changes applied
- All quantitative models and data preserved (as noted in diagnosis)
- Updated framing and terminology consistently applied throughout
- Full document structure maintained

**Note on approach:** The diagnosis shows good understanding of what needs updating - the strategic framing shift from generic "infrastructure" to "exploration architecture" is correct, and the plan to preserve quantitative rigor while updating positioning is sound. However, execution is incomplete.

### Suggested Improvements
- Ensure the opening section clearly positions this as validation of Grove's architectural bet, not just analysis
- Consider if the "Key Numbers for Decision-Makers" section could be strengthened with more direct connection to exploration architecture benefits
- Verify that model assumptions align with current checkpoint understanding of hybrid architecture timeline
