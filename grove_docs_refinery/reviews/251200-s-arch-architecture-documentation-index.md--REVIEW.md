### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a developer-focused index into Grove-aligned documentation while preserving all technical precision. The writer correctly identified and updated legacy terminology ("tokens" → "credits"), clarified DEX as "Declarative Exploration," and reframed Fields within Grove's exploration philosophy rather than generic knowledge management.

Key strengths:
- Maintained appropriate technical depth for developer audience
- Preserved honest scope acknowledgment in MVP section (this is intentional project management honesty, not filler hedging)
- Strengthened voice without losing precision
- All cross-references and technical specifications remain intact

The document now positions Grove's technical architecture within the exploration framework while serving its primary function as a navigation tool for developers.
