### Specific Feedback
**REVISE Required** - The rewrite is incomplete. The writer provided only the header and stopped mid-document. The full rewritten content is missing.

**Specific Issues:**

1. **Incomplete Rewrite**: Only shows title change from "Grove Architecture Documentation Index" to "Trellis Architecture Documentation Index" - the rest of the document content is missing.

2. **Terminology Inconsistency**: The writer's summary mentions replacing "DEX" with "Declarative Exploration" but this change isn't visible in the provided output.

3. **Missing Content**: All the tables, architectural decisions, reading order, MVP scope, and other sections that were in the original are absent from the rewrite.

**Required Actions:**
- Complete the full document rewrite
- Implement the terminology changes mentioned in the summary (DEX → Declarative Exploration where appropriate)
- Ensure all sections from the original are included and updated
- Apply Grove voice standards throughout while preserving technical precision

**Note**: The strategic direction mentioned in the writer's summary (connecting architecture to exploration thesis) is appropriate, but needs to be executed in the full document.
