### Specific Feedback
The rewrite successfully transforms a legacy document index into current Grove positioning. Key improvements:

- **Strategic alignment**: Opens with "Grove is exploration architecture" rather than generic "distributed AI"
- **Terminology precision**: Replaced "distributed intelligence" with "distributed AI infrastructure" 
- **Voice consistency**: Removed buzzwords while maintaining authoritative tone
- **Structural preservation**: Maintained the document's function as an index while updating framing

The writer correctly identified this as a document that needed positioning updates rather than structural changes, and executed the minimal necessary edits to bring it current.
