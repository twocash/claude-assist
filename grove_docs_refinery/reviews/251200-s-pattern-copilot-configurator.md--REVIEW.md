### Specific Feedback
This rewrite demonstrates excellent adherence to Grove standards. The writer correctly identified that the source document was already well-aligned with current positioning and made precise, targeted improvements without unnecessary changes.

**Key strengths:**
- Proper terminology mapping ("The Grove" → "Grove", "users" → "Observers")
- Maintained technical accuracy throughout schema and implementation details
- Enhanced voice consistency with confident, direct language
- Preserved all substantive content while tightening prose
- Strategic positioning remains sharp and well-articulated

**Changes appropriately applied:**
- Removed filler hedging ("emerges" → "is clear") while preserving technical caveats
- Consistent Observer terminology in relevant contexts
- Maintained the document's strong demonstration of Ratchet thesis and DEX principles
