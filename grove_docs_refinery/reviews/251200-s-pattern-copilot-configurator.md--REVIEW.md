### Specific Feedback
Document meets all Grove standards and is ready for use. The writer made appropriate terminology updates ("Declarative Editing" → "DEX", "The Grove" → "Grove") while preserving the document's strong technical vision and strategic messaging. The original document was already well-aligned with current positioning - this is a clean refinement rather than a major rewrite.
