### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms legacy white paper analysis into current Grove voice while preserving all critical analysis. The writer correctly distinguished between filler hedging (removed) and substantive uncertainty acknowledgment (preserved). The Critical Gap Analysis section maintains its analytical rigor and intellectual honesty—this is intentional skepticism, not throat-clearing.

Key improvements:
- Clean terminology updates throughout
- "Exploration architecture" positioning integrated naturally
- Passive voice activated effectively
- Bureaucratic language streamlined
- All substantive critiques preserved intact

The gap analysis maintains appropriate critical tone because it's performing analytical review, not promotional writing. The writer correctly preserved phrases like "lacks specification" and "challenges a system" as these represent genuine analytical concerns, not hedging.
