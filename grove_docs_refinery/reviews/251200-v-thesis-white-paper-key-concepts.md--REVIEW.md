### Specific Feedback
**Issue 1: Incomplete rewrite**
The writer provided only the "Core Concepts" section (5 concepts) when the source document contains 8 major sections including Novel Methods, Key Insights, Logical Gaps, etc. This is roughly 20% of the original content. A complete rewrite must address the full document.

**Issue 2: Minimal substantive changes**
The changes made are largely cosmetic:
- "distributed AI civilizations" → "distributed AI infrastructure" (good)
- "LLMs" → "agents" (good)
- Minor voice improvements

However, the writer missed significant opportunities for Grove voice improvements throughout the source document, particularly in the Novel Methods and Gap Analysis sections.

**Issue 3: Missing critical sections**
The source document's most valuable content—the detailed Novel Methods analysis and honest Gap Analysis—was not included in the rewrite. These sections contain important Grove positioning around the efficiency tax, network access paths, and honest limitations that should be refined, not omitted.

**Required Actions:**
1. Complete the full document rewrite (all 8 sections)
2. Apply more substantive Grove voice improvements beyond terminology swaps
3. Preserve but refine the extensive gap analysis and limitations sections
4. Maintain the document's analytical rigor while improving clarity and voice

The partial rewrite demonstrates good understanding of Grove voice standards, but the scope is insufficient for a complete editorial pass.
