### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms legacy positioning into current Grove voice standards. The opening pivot from "distributed AI" to "exploration architecture" immediately establishes the correct strategic frame. All terminology updates are properly applied (Credits, Observers/Gardeners, etc.), and the village metaphor is preserved while elevating the technical accuracy.

The writer correctly maintained substantive uncertainty acknowledgments (Ratchet timeline claims flagged for verification, hybrid architecture as bridge not destination) while removing filler hedging. The three architectural differences section effectively positions Grove's unique value without generic AI hype.

### Suggested Improvements
- The "~21 months" Ratchet claim should be verified against latest METR data before publication
- Consider adding a brief mention of university consortium strategy in the ownership discussion
- The "Capital distribution" economic argument is well-positioned but may benefit from a supporting citation in formal contexts
