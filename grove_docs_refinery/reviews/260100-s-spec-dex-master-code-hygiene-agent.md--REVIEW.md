### Specific Feedback
**Issues requiring revision:**

1. **Incomplete rewrite** — The writer provided only a header and first paragraph of the rewrite, not the full document. This makes validation impossible for 95% of the content.

2. **Unjustified terminology change** — Writer changed "grove-foundation" to "Foundation codebase" claiming clarity, but the original refers to a specific repository name (`grove-foundation`). This is a technical specification where precision matters more than general terminology alignment.

3. **Removed useful metaphor** — "Vision lens" was replaced with "architectural analysis" but the original metaphor effectively conveyed the agent's perspective-based approach. The change doesn't improve clarity.

**Minor issues:**
- The fragment shown does demonstrate improved active voice
- DEX context as "Declarative Exploration" is appropriate Grove terminology

**Required changes:**
1. Complete the full document rewrite
2. Restore "grove-foundation" as repository name (technical precision required)
3. Consider keeping "vision lens" metaphor or justify why "architectural analysis" is superior
4. Ensure all sections (scope rules, analysis passes, output formats, etc.) receive the same editorial attention as the header
