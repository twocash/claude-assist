### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully updates a technical sprint report to current Grove standards. The writer correctly identified that this is primarily factual documentation with minimal strategic positioning, making targeted terminology updates without over-editing. Key improvements:

- Clean terminology mapping ("Tokens" → "Credits", "DEX stack" → "Trellis Architecture layers")
- Removal of crypto-adjacent language ("federation" → "distributed operation") 
- All technical specifications preserved intact
- Appropriate restraint - didn't rewrite purely technical content unnecessarily

The document maintains its function as a sprint completion report while aligning with current Grove voice standards.
