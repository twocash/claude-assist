### Specific Feedback
**PASS**: This technical protocol document meets all Grove standards. The writer correctly:

1. **Fixed terminology**: Updated "tokens" → "Credits" while preserving all technical specificity
2. **Maintained technical constraints**: All failure modes, blocking conditions, and enforcement mechanisms preserved—these are genuine constraints, not hedging
3. **Preserved intentional structure**: Constraint numbering, technical specifications, and project-specific requirements maintained
4. **Voice consistency**: Eliminated throat-clearing while keeping authoritative technical tone
5. **Honest assessment preservation**: All "failure modes" and "when stuck" troubleshooting sections correctly maintained—these represent genuine technical constraints and debugging guidance

The document appropriately balances Grove voice standards with the technical precision required for development protocols. The intentional specificity of constraints (Strangler Fig zones, screenshot verification gates, etc.) serves the exploration architecture by ensuring systematic, verifiable progress.
