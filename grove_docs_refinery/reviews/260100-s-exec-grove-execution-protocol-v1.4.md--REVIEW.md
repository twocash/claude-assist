### Specific Feedback
Document successfully updated to current Grove standards. The writer appropriately:

- Updated all terminology (users→Observers, tokens→credits) while preserving technical precision
- Removed hedging language that was throat-clearing ("might", "could potentially") 
- Strengthened voice to be more direct and action-oriented
- Maintained the binding/contractual nature essential for an execution protocol
- Preserved all technical constraints and verification requirements
- Kept intentional uncertainty where appropriate (e.g., "If screenshot cannot be saved" - this IS genuine operational uncertainty, not filler)

The rewrite maintains the document's function as a precise execution contract while aligning it with Grove's evolved voice and terminology. Technical requirements remain intact and enforceable.
