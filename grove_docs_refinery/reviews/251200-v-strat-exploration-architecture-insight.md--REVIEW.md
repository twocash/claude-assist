### Specific Feedback
Document meets all Grove standards and is ready for use. The writer successfully:

- Updated "frontier models" to "foundation models" for consistency
- Integrated specific Grove mechanisms (DEX, Kinetic Stream, Diary System) without disrupting the core argument
- Strengthened claims with concrete implementation details
- Maintained the strategic framing while making it more Grove-specific
- Preserved all substantive content while tightening prose
- Connected the research validation explicitly to Grove's thesis and The Ratchet

The rewrite transforms a good strategic document into one that clearly positions Grove as the implementer of exploration architecture, rather than just describing the concept abstractly.
