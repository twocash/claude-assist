### Assessment: REVISE

### Validation Checklist
- [x] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned
- [x] Technical accuracy
- [x] Voice consistency
- [ ] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [ ] Changes justified
- [ ] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The writer states they made changes but provided an incomplete rewrite. The draft cuts off after the header and doesn't include the actual rewritten content. This makes validation impossible.

**Changes Claimed vs. Changes Delivered**:
- Writer claims "Updated terminology: 'LLMs' → 'AI models'" but the full rewrite isn't provided
- Writer claims "Strengthened voice consistency" but there's no content to verify
- Writer claims "Removed redundant provenance notes" but the truncated version still shows incomplete processing

**Required Actions**:
1. **Provide the complete rewritten document** - The current submission only includes headers and metadata
2. **Justify the "LLMs" → "AI models" change** - The original uses "LLMs" in a research citation context where precision matters. This change needs strategic justification.
3. **Clarify provenance handling** - The original has complex provenance notes that appear partially processed. Need clean resolution.

**Additional Notes**:
The original document is already well-aligned with current Grove positioning. The historical parallel ("exploration architecture is to AI what information architecture was to the internet") is strong and current. Any changes should be minimal and clearly justified.

**Return to writer with instruction**: Provide the complete rewritten content for proper validation.
