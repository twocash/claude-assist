## Review: 251200-V-RESEARCH-FunctionGemma Validates Hybrid Theory.md
### Assessment: REVISE

### Validation Checklist
- [x] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned
- [x] Technical accuracy
- [x] Voice consistency
- [ ] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [ ] Changes justified
- [ ] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**CRITICAL ISSUE: Incomplete rewrite provided**

The writer indicated they made key changes including "Fixed terminology: 'tokens' → 'credits' throughout" but only provided the title and header of the rewritten document. The main body content is missing entirely.

**Changes that need to be completed:**
1. The full rewritten document must be provided, not just the header
2. All instances of "tokens" should be replaced with "credits" where referring to Grove's internal economy
3. Legacy terminology should be updated per checkpoint mapping
4. Dense academic phrasing should be simplified while preserving technical precision

**Additional Notes:**
- The writer correctly identified key issues (terminology, complexity)
- Flags about Google partnership claims and three-tier architecture are appropriate
- But without the actual rewritten content, validation cannot be completed

**Return to writer with instruction to provide the complete rewritten document.**

### Suggested Improvements
- Ensuring technical complexity remains accessible (8th-grade level sentences)
- Verifying that uncertainty about tradeoffs is preserved as intentional honesty
- Confirming bibliography and citations remain intact
