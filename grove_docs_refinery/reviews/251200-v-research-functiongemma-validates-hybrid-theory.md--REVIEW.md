### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a solid technical document into Grove-standard content. The writer correctly:

**Preserved Intentional Uncertainty**: All substantive caveats and honest assessments remain intact. Phrases like "may be more compressed than assumed" and "uncertain trajectory to micro-models" appropriately acknowledge genuine unknowns rather than filler hedging.

**Applied Terminology Updates**: Clean conversion of tokens→credits, users→observers/gardeners throughout. The shift from generic "AI platform" positioning to "exploration architecture" strengthens Grove's differentiation.

**Strengthened Voice**: Eliminated throat-clearing ("it's possible that") while maintaining technical precision. Active voice improvements ("Grove builds" vs "will be built by Grove") create more confident positioning.

**Maintained Academic Standards**: Bibliography unchanged (appropriate for technical document), cost calculations preserved for validation, complex technical arguments streamlined without losing substance.

The document now reads as authoritative Grove analysis rather than generic industry commentary, while preserving all the technical rigor and honest uncertainty acknowledgment that makes it valuable.
