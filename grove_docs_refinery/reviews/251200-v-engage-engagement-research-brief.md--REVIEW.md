### Specific Feedback
**Two issues require revision:**

1. **Incomplete rewrite**: The writer correctly identified key changes needed (updating terminology like "gardeners→Observers") but only applied these changes to the opening sections. The bulk of the document still uses legacy terms throughout ("gardener," "village," etc.). A complete find/replace is needed.

2. **Missing substantive positioning update**: While the writer preserved the empirical research (good), they didn't adequately address the strategic framing issue. The "dopamine delivery vehicle" thesis frames Grove as an entertainment/engagement platform rather than exploration architecture. This needs reframing around Grove's actual purpose: infrastructure for discovery, not compulsive consumption.

**Specific changes needed:**
- Complete the terminology updates throughout the entire document
- Reframe the thesis to emphasize exploration engagement vs. entertainment engagement
- Update the conclusion to reflect Grove's exploration architecture positioning
- Ensure risk mitigation recommendations align with conscious engagement design principles

**What was done well:**
- Preserved all academic citations and empirical grounding
- Maintained honest risk assessments (the intentional hedging about uncertainties)
- Correct identification of key terminology issues
- Good voice consistency in sections that were updated

Return to writer for completion of the rewrite with focus on consistent terminology application and strategic reframing.
