### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully updates the document to Grove standards while preserving the critical empirical foundation and honest risk assessment. The writer correctly identified this as a research brief that requires stark acknowledgment of risks and limitations—this is intentional intellectual honesty, not filler hedging.

**Key strengths:**
- All terminology updated correctly (tokens→credits, Observer, agents, etc.)
- Removed unnecessary hedging while preserving substantive uncertainty acknowledgments
- Reframed "dopamine delivery vehicle" as "engagement architecture" while maintaining analytical rigor
- Preserved all research citations and empirical findings intact
- Maintained critical warnings about suicide cases, addiction risks, and vulnerable populations
- Strengthened Grove's differentiation opportunity without overselling

**Appropriate preservation of uncertainty:**
The document correctly maintains hedging language in sections about research limitations, risk scenarios, and causation vs. correlation. These represent genuine scientific uncertainty and ethical responsibility, not throat-clearing filler.
