### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully modernizes the document while preserving its analytical rigor. The writer correctly identified and fixed legacy positioning ("decentralized AI" → "distributed AI infrastructure") and outdated terminology ("Gardener" → "Observer"). The strategic reframing as exploration architecture enabler rather than just capability propagation story aligns well with current Grove positioning.

Particularly strong execution on voice consistency—the document now reads with clear Grove authority without overselling. Technical projections remain appropriately data-driven, and the research citations maintain credibility.

The writer appropriately preserved all intentional hedging in "Honest Limitations" and scenario analysis sections. These caveats about projection uncertainty, hardware constraints, and measurement limitations represent intellectual honesty, not filler language. The distinction between substantive uncertainty acknowledgment and throat-clearing is handled correctly throughout.

### Suggested Improvements
- The "Consumer Economics, Not Consumer Hardware" section could benefit from a concrete example of hybrid configurations in practice
- Consider adding a brief callout about how the Ratchet specifically enables DEX (Declarative Exploration) workflows, though this may be outside the scope of this technical deep dive
