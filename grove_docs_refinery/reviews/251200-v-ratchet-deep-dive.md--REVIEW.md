### Specific Feedback
**Issue: Incomplete rewrite provided**

The writer provided only the header and metadata of the rewritten document, not the full rewritten content. I can see the diagnosis summary shows good understanding of needed changes:

- Terminology updates (Worldsmiths→Observers, Gardeners→users)
- Removing unnecessary hedging while preserving intentional caveats
- Alignment with exploration architecture positioning

However, I cannot validate the actual rewrite since only the title and opening metadata were provided.

**Required for resubmission:**
1. Provide the complete rewritten document content
2. Ensure all terminology updates are consistently applied throughout
3. Verify that the "Honest Limitations" section preserves its intentional uncertainty language (this is substantive intellectual honesty, not filler)
4. Check that economic projections and scenario matrices maintain appropriate caveats

**Note on intentional honesty:** The original document's "Honest Limitations" section correctly uses hedging language like "may not continue," "could prove wrong," "assumption could prove wrong" - this is intentional intellectual honesty about projection uncertainty and should be preserved.
