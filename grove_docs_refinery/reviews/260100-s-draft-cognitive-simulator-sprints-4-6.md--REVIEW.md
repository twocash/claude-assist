### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a technical development document into Grove-standard content while preserving its essential technical integrity. The writer correctly identified and eliminated legacy terminology ("chatbot," lowercase "credits") and removed filler hedging while maintaining substantive uncertainty acknowledgment in appropriate contexts.

Key strengths:
- Clean terminology updates throughout (Observer, Credits, etc.)
- Tightened prose without losing technical precision
- Preserved honest assessments of constraints and risks
- Maintained the document's pedagogical purpose while improving clarity

The writer showed good judgment in keeping "visitor" when specifically referring to website visitors (distinct from Observers in the agent context) and preserving technical constraints as intentional honesty rather than hedging to remove.
