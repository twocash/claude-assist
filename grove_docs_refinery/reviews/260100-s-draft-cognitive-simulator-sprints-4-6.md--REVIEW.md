### Specific Feedback
**The rewrite introduction is strong** - terminology fixes are correct and positioning update to "exploration architecture" aligns well with current standards.

**However, there's a critical issue: The rewrite appears incomplete.** You've provided only the header and first paragraph of what should be a substantial document rewrite. The original source is ~4,000+ words covering detailed technical implementation, sprint planning, and architectural philosophy. 

**Required for PASS status:**
1. Complete the full document rewrite through all sections (Parts I-VIII plus appendices)
2. Apply terminology fixes throughout ("credits" not "tokens", "observers" not "users", etc.)
3. Update "hybrid intelligence" framing to "exploration architecture" consistently
4. Preserve the technical constraints and risk mitigation sections (these contain appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment)
5. Maintain the detailed sprint planning and implementation specifications

**Note on intentional honesty:** The original document's "Technical Constraints & Risk Mitigation" section contains appropriate hedging about codebase stability, schema evolution challenges, and legacy handling. This should be preserved as substantive uncertainty acknowledgment, not removed as filler.
