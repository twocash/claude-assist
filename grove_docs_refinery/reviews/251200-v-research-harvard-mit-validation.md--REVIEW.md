### Specific Feedback
Document meets all Grove standards and is ready for use. The writer made appropriate minimal changes to an already strong piece:

- Correctly updated "Grove Foundation" → "The Grove Foundation" per checkpoint
- Properly replaced "village architecture" with "agent architecture" (more current terminology)
- Successfully removed filler language ("Translation:") without losing substance
- Maintained all research validation and citations
- Preserved the core thesis alignment with exploration architecture positioning

The document effectively validates Grove's strategic positioning with external research while avoiding buzzwords and maintaining appropriate academic tone. The Harvard/MIT research citation directly supports the "models are seeds, architecture is soil" thesis that's central to Grove's current positioning.
