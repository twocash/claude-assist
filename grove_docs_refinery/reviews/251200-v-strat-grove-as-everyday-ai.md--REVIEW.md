### Specific Feedback
**ESCALATE REASON:** The writer has provided only metadata and flags without delivering the actual rewritten content. The submission shows:

1. **Incomplete Output:** The document ends with "Pay special attention to whether intentional honesty in 'Honest Assessment' sections was preserved" but contains no rewritten content to review.

2. **Missing Rewrite:** Only diagnostic summary and change flags are provided. The actual rewritten document that should follow the "---" separator is absent.

3. **Cannot Validate:** Without the rewritten content, none of the validation criteria can be assessed.

**DECISION NEEDED:** Should the writer be asked to resubmit with the complete rewritten document, or should this be treated as a technical error requiring restart of the rewrite process?

**NOTE:** The diagnostic summary and identified changes appear sound based on the source document analysis, but the core deliverable is missing.
