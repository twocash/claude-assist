### Specific Feedback
**Major Issue: Incomplete Rewrite**
The writer provided only the title and executive summary. The full document needs to be rewritten, not just the opening section. The original document is substantial (~4,000 words) and contains multiple sections that require updating.

**What Needs to Be Completed:**
1. **Part 1: The Demand Signal** - Update framing from generic AI memory to exploration-specific memory needs
2. **Part 2: Supply Economics** - Preserve economic models but align with current Grove positioning
3. **Part 3: What Could Be Stored** - Connect to Grove's diary systems and knowledge commons
4. **Part 4: Foundation's Evolved Role** - Critical section needing alignment with current governance thinking
5. **Part 5-7: Technical feasibility, risks, recommendations** - Update technical references to current architecture

**Positive Elements in Provided Section:**
- Good terminology updates (tokens→credits, users→gardeners)
- Strong reframing around "exploration architecture"
- Maintains technical precision while improving clarity
- Appropriate voice and tone

**Required Next Steps:**
Complete the full document rewrite, paying particular attention to:
- Connecting infrastructure economics to exploration use cases
- Updating Foundation role discussion with current governance thinking
- Preserving all risk assessments and technical feasibility analysis
- Maintaining economic projections while updating contextual framing
