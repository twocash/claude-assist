### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a strategic analysis from legacy framing into current Grove positioning. The writer correctly:

**Terminology Updates:**
- Replaced "tokens" → "credits" 
- Updated "users" → "Gardeners/Observers" contextually
- Reframed "buying cooperative" → "infrastructure consumer/orchestrator"

**Voice Improvements:**
- Eliminated filler hedging ("could potentially," "it's possible that")
- Strengthened weak constructions ("proves more efficient" vs "may be more efficient")
- Maintained active voice throughout

**Critical: Intentional Honesty Preserved**
The writer correctly distinguished between filler hedging and substantive uncertainty:
- **Preserved** legitimate hedging in Risk Analysis section ("could undercut," "might need")
- **Preserved** honest assessments about unknowns and challenges
- **Removed** only throat-clearing language outside these contexts

**Strategic Alignment:**
- Updated positioning from generic "distributed AI" to "exploration architecture"
- Clarified Foundation's evolved role as market maker vs obsolescence
- Maintained substantive economic analysis while improving clarity

The document retains its analytical depth while now speaking in Grove's current voice. All technical content appears accurate and the strategic insights remain intact.
