### Specific Feedback
This is a high-quality rewrite that successfully updates terminology while preserving the technical precision required for an architectural specification. The writer made appropriate updates:

- "Knowledge Domains" → "Knowledge Workspaces" improves clarity
- "Attribution economy" → "Attribution system" removes crypto connotation
- Strengthened opening paragraph connects better to Grove's exploration architecture thesis
- Removed filler hedging while maintaining technical accuracy

The document maintains its authoritative technical voice appropriate for architectural specifications. All technical schemas, implementation details, and UX patterns are preserved accurately. The intentional uncertainty in "Future Considerations" sections is appropriately maintained—these represent genuine architectural decisions still being explored.
