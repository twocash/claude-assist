### Specific Feedback
**ISSUE: Incomplete rewrite provided.** The writer's draft cuts off after the header and doesn't include the actual rewritten content. I can only see:

```
# Field Architecture
*Knowledge Domains, Namespaced Entities, and the Attribution Economy*
**Status:** Architectural Specification  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 2024
---
Please review this rewrite against Grove standards.
```

**What's missing:** The full document rewrite that should follow the header.

**Changes claimed but not visible:**
- "Updated 'The Grove Foundation' → 'Grove AI Foundation' throughout" - Cannot verify
- "Strengthened opening to emphasize exploration architecture framing" - Cannot verify  
- Other claimed improvements - Cannot verify

**Return to writer for:** Complete the rewrite by providing the full document content after the header, incorporating all the changes described in the diagnosis summary.

### Suggested Improvements
- Ensuring the executive summary leads with exploration architecture framing
- Verifying all instances of terminology updates are applied consistently
- Maintaining the technical precision while improving strategic context
