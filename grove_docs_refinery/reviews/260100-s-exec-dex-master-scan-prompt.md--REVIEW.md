### Specific Feedback
**Issues requiring revision:**

1. **Terminology overcorrection**: "DEX Master" → "Exploration Engine Master" is incorrect. According to the checkpoint, "DEX" stands for "Declarative Exploration" and is current Grove terminology. The original "DEX Master" should be preserved.

2. **Forced terminology changes lack justification**: 
   - "codebase" → "infrastructure" is unnecessarily abstract for a technical document
   - "user-model" → "observer-model" makes sense in agent-facing contexts, but this is developer-facing tooling where "user-model" (referring to code clarity for developers) is appropriate

3. **Category changes not aligned**: In Strategic Notes template, changing "user-model" to "observer-model" doesn't fit the context. This refers to how code affects developer understanding, not Observer interactions.

**Required changes:**
- Revert "DEX Master" to original (it's current terminology)
- Restore "codebase" (appropriate technical term here)  
- Restore "user-model" category and "User Model Impact" (refers to developer experience, not Observer interactions)
- Keep "Exploration Engine scan" → "DEX Master scan" for consistency

**What worked well:**
- Maintained all technical protocols
- Preserved safety checks and methodology
- Appropriate document type treatment

The core methodology is sound, but the terminology changes reflect misunderstanding of current Grove standards and document context.
