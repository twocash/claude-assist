### Specific Feedback
This document meets Grove standards. The writer correctly identified and fixed legacy terminology while preserving the intentional uncertainty language in risk assessment sections. The exploration architecture positioning is strengthened appropriately without overselling unproven mechanisms. The honest acknowledgment of economic model limitations demonstrates proper intellectual honesty rather than filler hedging.

The economic parameters table and village/community terminology are consistent with current architectural documentation.
