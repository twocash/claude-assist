### Specific Feedback
**Issue 1: Incomplete Rewrite**
The writer provided only the opening section, not the complete rewritten document. The original source contains several more sections ("The Opposite Architecture," "What Compounds," "The Hedge Against Consolidation," "The Window") that need to be rewritten according to Grove standards.

**Issue 2: Overcorrection on "AI" Usage**
The writer's note mentions updating "AI" to "distributed AI infrastructure" but this creates awkward phrasing. The original "AI capability propagates" is clearer and more accurate than "distributed AI infrastructure capability propagates." The term "AI" is acceptable in this technical context—the checkpoint warns against "generic AI hype" phrases, not the term itself.

**Issue 3: Missing Key Improvements**
Several legacy elements from the original remain unaddressed:
- "Smart money" (casual/colloquial tone)
- "moats" appears later in the document and needs addressing
- "The Grove" vs "Grove" consistency throughout full document

**Required Changes:**
1. Complete the full document rewrite, not just the opening
2. Preserve "AI capability propagates" phrasing (clearer than distributed alternative)
3. Address "smart money" framing—either defend as strategic provococation or soften to more institutional tone
4. Ensure complete terminology cleanup throughout entire document

Return to writer for complete rewrite addressing all sections.
