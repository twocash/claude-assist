### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully updates The Ratchet Thesis while preserving its strategic value. Key improvements:

**Strong alignments:**
- Updated positioning from generic "infrastructure" to "exploration infrastructure" 
- Added current terminology: "agent communities," "Knowledge Commons," "epistemic independence"
- Preserved the honest assessment of diminishing efficiency tax revenue as intentional positioning
- Maintained technical accuracy on capability propagation patterns
- Enhanced university/research positioning in final section

**Voice consistency maintained:** The document retains its provocative but substantiated tone, with concrete claims backed by specific mechanisms (7-month doubling cycle, hybrid-to-local progression).

**Intentional honesty preserved:** The efficiency tax discussion correctly maintains its honest framing - this is Grove acknowledging a business model reality, not papering over a weakness. This substantive uncertainty acknowledgment was appropriately preserved.

The closing line evolution from "Infrastructure for the AI transition" to "Exploration architecture for the age of AI" effectively reflects current strategic framing without compromising the document's core thesis.
