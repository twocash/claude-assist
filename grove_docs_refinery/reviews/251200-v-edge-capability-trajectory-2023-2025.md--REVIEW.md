### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a generic "Edge AI" analysis into Grove-aligned content while preserving all technical rigor and citations. The writer correctly:

- Updated terminology ("Local AI Infrastructure" vs "Edge AI", "distributed AI infrastructure" vs "distributed intelligence")
- Connected technical findings to Grove's Ratchet Thesis in the conclusion without forcing the connection throughout
- Maintained academic tone appropriate for a research brief
- Preserved all quantitative data, benchmarks, and citations exactly
- Kept honest assessments about limitations (e.g., "could not be verified" for Snapdragon specs)
- Strengthened the conclusion to support Grove's strategic positioning while remaining factually grounded

The document now serves Grove's strategic positioning while maintaining its value as an independent technical analysis.
