### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a generic edge AI analysis into a Grove-specific validation of the Ratchet thesis. The writer correctly:

- **Reframed the entire document** around Grove's "models are seeds, architecture is soil" positioning rather than generic "decentralized AI" trends
- **Fixed terminology** throughout (tokens→credits, etc.) while preserving technical precision
- **Activated the voice** by removing passive constructions and academic hedging
- **Connected empirical evidence** to Grove's specific architectural choices at every major section
- **Preserved technical accuracy** while updating strategic frame
- **Maintained appropriate uncertainty** about future timelines and technical constraints

The conclusion particularly effectively ties the technical evidence to Grove's exploration architecture thesis rather than making generic predictions about "the future of AI."
