### Specific Feedback
This is a strong rewrite that successfully transforms a technical specification into Grove-aligned content while preserving all technical precision. Key improvements:

1. **Strategic Framing**: Opening now positions this within Grove's exploration architecture rather than generic configuration tooling
2. **Terminology Alignment**: Correctly uses "Observers" instead of "users" and frames within distributed AI infrastructure
3. **Voice Consistency**: Maintains technical precision while removing unnecessary hedging ("What's missing" vs "What needs evolution")
4. **Intentional Honesty Preserved**: The "Open Questions" section appropriately retains uncertainty language—these are genuine technical decisions, not filler hedging

The writer correctly preserved engineering-specific conventions (Pattern 10, DEX Compliance, sprint naming) that appear to be intentional operational frameworks rather than legacy terminology.
