### Specific Feedback
The writer provided a diagnosis and change summary but **did not include the actual rewritten content**. Only the header and metadata were provided after "---". 

I cannot validate the rewrite without seeing the rewritten document. The writer needs to:

1. Provide the complete rewritten content below the metadata header
2. Show the actual implementation of claimed changes (terminology updates, voice tightening, etc.)

The diagnosis looks sound - updating "Grove Foundation" to "Foundation," replacing "LLM" with "agent," removing hedging, and strengthening active voice are all appropriate Grove Editorial Engine applications. However, without the rewritten content, I cannot verify these changes were properly executed.

**Return to writer with instruction:** Please provide the complete rewritten document content, not just the metadata and diagnosis.
