### Specific Feedback
This is an excellent rewrite that successfully transforms a generic distributed systems document into Grove-specific exploration architecture content while preserving all technical rigor. The writer correctly:

- Updated framing from "decentralized AI networks" to "Grove's exploration architecture" throughout
- Replaced legacy terminology ("decentralized" → "distributed", "villages" → "agent communities")  
- Added Grove-specific application context to each technical section without losing academic precision
- Maintained all research citations, data points, and technical parameters
- Preserved the document's technical deep-dive nature appropriate for the target audience

The voice transformation is particularly strong—moving from generic distributed systems language to Grove's strategic positioning around exploration infrastructure and epistemic independence. Technical hedging language was appropriately removed while preserving substantive uncertainty acknowledgments in research citations.

All Grove-specific additions feel natural and well-integrated rather than tacked on. The synthesis section effectively connects academic research to Grove's practical architecture needs.
