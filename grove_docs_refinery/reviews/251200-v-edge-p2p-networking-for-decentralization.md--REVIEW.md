- [ ] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**REVISE REQUIRED:** The writer made minimal changes to what is fundamentally a strong technical document, but missed several critical terminology updates required by the checkpoint:

1. **Incomplete terminology mapping:**
   - Document still uses "decentralized village infrastructure" (should be "distributed AI infrastructure")
   - Contains "decentralized AI coordination" (should be "distributed AI coordination")
   - References "Grove's decentralized village infrastructure" in multiple locations

2. **Missing strategic context:**
   - The document lacks any connection to Grove's exploration architecture thesis
   - Should establish why P2P networking matters for exploration vs. optimization
   - The executive summary mentions "Grove's decentralized village infrastructure" without explaining what Grove actually is

3. **Structural issues:**
   - The document reads as pure technical analysis without connecting to Grove's strategic positioning
   - Needs a brief opening that establishes Grove's exploration architecture context before diving into technical details

**Required Changes:**
- Complete find/replace of remaining "decentralized" instances with "distributed"
- Add 1-2 sentences in opening establishing Grove as exploration architecture
- Connect technical capabilities to exploration use cases (why does NAT traversal matter for agent discovery?)
- Update "village infrastructure" references to align with current terminology

The technical content is excellent and should be preserved. The academic rigor and honest assessment of limitations (70% NAT success rates, hybrid architecture necessity) are exactly what Grove content should contain.

### Suggested Improvements
- Consider adding a brief conclusion that ties the technical capabilities back to Grove's exploration mission
- The document could benefit from one concrete example of how these P2P advances enable agent exploration scenarios
