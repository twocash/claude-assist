### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a solid technical specification into Grove-standard content while preserving all essential architectural detail. The writer made appropriate voice refinements without compromising technical precision.

Key strengths:
- Successfully updated "meta-framework" to "standard" (better positioning)
- Properly aligned "The Observer" terminology in human-AI symbiosis section
- Strengthened conclusion with current Grove positioning ("exploration processes generate value independent of component capabilities")
- Maintained all technical schemas and implementation details intact
- Preserved DEX principles without modification (correctly identified as core to specification)

The document now reflects current Grove voice while serving its function as an authoritative architectural specification.
