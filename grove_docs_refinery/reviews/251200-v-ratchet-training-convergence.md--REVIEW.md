### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a generic distributed AI research report into content that serves Grove's strategic positioning. The writer correctly preserved all technical data, honest assessments of trajectory uncertainties, and substantive caveats while eliminating buzzword language and aligning the framing with exploration architecture.

Key strengths:
- Strategic reframing connects training capabilities directly to Grove's epistemic independence thesis
- All technical projections and EPOCH data preserved with appropriate uncertainty language
- University partnership angle properly emphasized in conclusion
- Voice is authoritative but accessible throughout
- Honest assessments (like EPOCH's "won't see catch up this decade") appropriately retained

The document now serves as strong technical validation for Grove's infrastructure approach while maintaining research credibility.
