### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully maintains the technical precision and practical focus of the original while aligning with Grove voice standards. The changes are minimal and appropriate for a technical specification document. The writer correctly preserved all technical details, code samples, and implementation specifics while making subtle improvements to voice and terminology consistency.

### Suggested Improvements
- The build time estimates in the "Build Sequence" section might benefit from validation against actual development experience, as the writer flagged
- Consider adding a brief note about how this tool integrates with Grove's broader exploration architecture, though this may be beyond scope for an internal dev tool spec
