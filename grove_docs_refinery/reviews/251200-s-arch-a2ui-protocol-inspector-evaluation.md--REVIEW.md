### Specific Feedback
Document successfully updated to reflect current Grove standards while preserving all technical substance. The writer correctly identified and replaced legacy terminology without altering the technical analysis or strategic recommendations. Most importantly, the intentional uncertainty language in assessment sections (like "may not reach critical mass," "expect changes," "limited renderer ecosystem") was properly preserved as these represent legitimate technical caveats, not filler hedging.

The document maintains its technical specification character with appropriate authoritative tone and concrete recommendations. Strategic positioning now aligns with Grove's exploration architecture framing rather than generic platform language.
