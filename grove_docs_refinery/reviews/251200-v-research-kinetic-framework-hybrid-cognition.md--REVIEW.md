### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a strategic vision document into current Grove voice while preserving essential uncertainties. The "Honest Assessment" section properly maintains substantive hedging about risks and constraints—this is intellectual honesty, not filler. The writer correctly distinguished between throat-clearing hedging (removed) and legitimate uncertainty acknowledgment (preserved).

Key strengths:
- Clean terminology alignment ("Grove" not "The Grove", "Agent Skills" not "Proto-Skills")
- Strong opening that leads with "so what" (Grove as proof-of-concept, framework as infrastructure)
- Proper integration of Ratchet thesis and epistemic independence framing
- Maintains strategic ambition while acknowledging real constraints
- Technical descriptions align with current checkpoint
