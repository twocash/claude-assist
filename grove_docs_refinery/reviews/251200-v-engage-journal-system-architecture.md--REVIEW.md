### Specific Feedback
This is a high-quality rewrite that successfully updates the document to current Grove standards while preserving its academic rigor and research foundation. The writer correctly:

- **Updated terminology**: "Journal" → "Diary", "The Grove" → "Grove", standardized "The Observer"
- **Removed filler hedging** while preserving substantive uncertainty in ethical considerations
- **Strengthened claims** about the diary system's dual purpose without overstating
- **Maintained intentional honesty** in the "Ethical Design Considerations" section where cautionary language serves genuine intellectual purpose
- **Preserved research citations** that validate Grove's approach
- **Aligned with current positioning** as exploration architecture

The document appropriately acknowledges tensions and unknowns (AI relationship ethics, vulnerability dynamics) while being confident about what Grove actually does. The voice is consistently Grove-appropriate: authoritative but not smug, concrete rather than abstract.
