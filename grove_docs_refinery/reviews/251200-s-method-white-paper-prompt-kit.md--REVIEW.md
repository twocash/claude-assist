### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully updates the prompt kit to current Grove standards while preserving the document's functional integrity. The writer correctly:

- Updated legacy terminology ("Gardener" → "Observer", "communities/villages" → "agent communities")
- Aligned architectural descriptions with hybrid approach
- Strengthened voice guidance to eliminate filler hedging while preserving intentional constraint discussions
- Updated copyright to 2026
- Maintained the kit's practical utility for generating white papers

**Intentional honesty preservation verified**: The "Technical Constraints (Honest Assessment)" section correctly retains hedging language like "7B quantized models have significant limitations" and "NAT traversal fails ~50% of connections." This is substantive uncertainty acknowledgment, not throat-clearing filler.

The voice guide improvements are particularly strong—removing weak hedging ("potentially represents an innovative approach") while keeping honest technical assessments intact.
