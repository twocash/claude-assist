## Review: 251230-S-ARCH-Trellis Bedrock Addendum.md
### Assessment: REVISE

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned
- [x] Technical accuracy
- [x] Voice consistency
- [x] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [x] Changes justified
- [x] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**Critical Issue - Incomplete Rewrite:** The writer provided only the header and metadata, not the actual rewritten content. The document ends abruptly after the title block with no body content.

**Terminology Issues Identified:**
- Writer correctly flagged "DEX Stack" → "Grove Architecture" but the rewrite is missing to verify implementation
- Need to see actual content to validate other terminology updates

**Required Actions:**
1. **Complete the rewrite** - Provide the full document body with all sections rewritten
2. **Verify terminology consistency** throughout the complete document
3. **Ensure all section headers and content are included**

The writer's diagnosis was accurate and the planned changes are appropriate, but without the actual rewritten content, I cannot validate compliance with Grove standards.

### Suggested Improvements
- Pay attention to maintaining the technical precision required for implementation docs
- Ensure all code examples and architectural patterns remain exactly as specified
