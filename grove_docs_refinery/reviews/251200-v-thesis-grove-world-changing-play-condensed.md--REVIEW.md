### Specific Feedback
**PASS**: This rewrite successfully transforms a December 2025 document into current Grove standards while preserving all substantive value. The writer correctly identified and updated legacy terminology throughout ("tokens" → "credits", "distributed AI" → "exploration architecture", etc.) and removed generic hedging language while carefully preserving intentional uncertainty in honest assessment sections.

**Particularly Strong Elements:**
- Clean terminology mapping without losing meaning
- Proper preservation of all uncertainty language in Sections 7.1-7.7 and other "Honest Caveats" areas
- Updated strategic framing to exploration architecture without forcing it
- Maintained the document's scholarly tone while activating passive constructions
- Preserved the valuable "Horse Moment" conclusion despite the flag - it works within the broader infrastructure ownership argument

**Technical Accuracy Confirmed:**
- All architectural descriptions align with current checkpoint
- Economic mechanisms properly described per current understanding
- Governance transition triggers accurately represented

The writer's approach was methodical and appropriate - mechanical terminology fixes first, then strategic alignment, then prose tightening. No substantive content was lost in the process.
