### Specific Feedback
**CRITICAL ISSUE: Missing Content**

The writer provided only a title and brief summary instead of the complete rewritten document. The "rewrite" contains:
- A new title: "Grove: Exploration Architecture for the Age of AI"
- Author attribution
- Date update (January 2026)
- Writer's diagnostic notes

But the actual rewritten content is missing entirely. The original document was ~15,000 words covering The Ratchet thesis, system architecture, economics, governance, and constraints. The submitted rewrite contains perhaps 50 words.

**What's Needed:**

The writer must provide the complete rewritten document, not just metadata. The document should include:

1. **The Ratchet Thesis** (Section 1) - Core capability propagation argument
2. **System Architecture** (Section 2) - Local nodes, hybrid cognition, network layer
3. **Terminal Experience** (Section 3) - User interface and utility tiers
4. **Economic Mechanism** (Section 4) - Credits system and efficiency tax
5. **User Experience** (Section 5) - Gardener relationship and diary system
6. **Governance & Transition** (Section 6) - Foundation obsolescence plan
7. **Honest Assessment** (Section 7) - Constraints, risks, and unknowns
8. **Conclusion** - Strategic positioning and call to action

**What Was Good:**
- Title change to "Exploration Architecture for the Age of AI" properly emphasizes current positioning
- Date updated to January 2026
- Writer correctly identified need to preserve intentional honesty sections

**Required Action:**
Return to writer with instruction to complete the full rewrite, not just the header and summary.
