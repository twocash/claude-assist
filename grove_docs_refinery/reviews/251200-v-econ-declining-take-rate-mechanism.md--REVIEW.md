### Specific Feedback
**ISSUE: Incomplete rewrite** - The writer flagged several changes in their summary but only provided the updated header. The full document body remains unchanged, still containing:

- Legacy term "The Grove" (should be "Grove")
- "rake" terminology throughout (writer said they'd change to "efficiency tax")
- Original copyright/provenance formatting

**Required changes:**
1. Apply ALL the changes described in the writer's summary throughout the full document
2. Update "rake" to "efficiency tax" consistently 
3. Change "The Grove" to "Grove" throughout
4. Apply updated copyright/provenance formatting

**Additional observation:** The writer correctly preserved the substantive uncertainty language in the "Risks" section - terms like "could falsify" and "can look like" are appropriate hedging for genuine analytical uncertainty, not filler.
