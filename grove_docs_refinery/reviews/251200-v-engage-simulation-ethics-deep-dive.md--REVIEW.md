### Specific Feedback
Document meets all Grove standards. The writer correctly identified and fixed legacy terminology while preserving the document's extensive honest assessment sections. The psychological risk discussions, technical constraint acknowledgments, and uncertainty about engagement outcomes are intentionally transparent—exactly the kind of intellectual honesty Grove's "acknowledge tensions, don't paper over" positioning requires.

Key improvements executed well:
- Organization name updated to current "Grove AI Foundation"
- Terminal interface reference corrected
- User/Observer/Gardener terminology properly applied by context
- Voice strengthened without losing substantive caveats

The document's detailed coverage of addiction risks, tragic AI chatbot incidents, and technical limitations represents Grove's commitment to honest positioning rather than buzzword-driven marketing. This level of transparency differentiates Grove from platforms that exploit engagement mechanisms while claiming ignorance.
