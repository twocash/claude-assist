### Specific Feedback
Document successfully updated to Grove standards. The writer correctly:

1. **Preserved all intentional hedging** in risk assessment sections - phrases like "may produce," "could create," "might not prevent" are substantive uncertainty acknowledgments, not filler
2. **Updated terminology consistently** - "The Grove"→"Grove," "users"→"Observers/Gardeners," "The-Grove.ai Foundation"→"Grove Foundation," "Journal"→"Diary System"
3. **Maintained technical accuracy** - all research citations, psychological mechanisms, and architectural constraints remain intact
4. **Improved prose flow** - removed throat-clearing while keeping substantive content

The document's frank discussion of engagement psychology and addiction risks exemplifies Grove's commitment to intellectual honesty. The "Honest Assessment" sections appropriately contain hedging language because they're acknowledging genuine uncertainties about psychological outcomes - this is intentional intellectual integrity, not weak writing.
