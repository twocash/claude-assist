- [ ] Appropriate length

### Specific Feedback
**CRITICAL ISSUE:** The rewrite is incomplete. The writer provided only the header and first few lines, cutting off after "**Branch:** `bedrock`". This appears to be a truncated draft rather than a complete rewrite.

**What's Missing:**
- Entire document body (Preamble, all Articles I-VIII)
- All technical specifications
- Console pattern requirements
- Object model compliance sections
- Enforcement mechanisms

**What Was Provided (Good):**
- Proper Grove terminology updates mentioned in diagnosis
- Strategic framing alignment noted
- Awareness of exploration architecture context

**Required Action:**
Writer must provide the complete rewritten document. The diagnosis shows understanding of needed changes, but the execution is incomplete.

**Specific Instructions for Revision:**
1. Provide the full document rewrite, not just the header
2. Apply the terminology changes mentioned in the diagnosis throughout
3. Maintain all technical requirements and binding language
4. Preserve the contract's authoritative tone while updating Grove positioning
