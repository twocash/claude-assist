### Specific Feedback
The rewrite successfully maintains the document's authoritative contract tone while making appropriate Grove-aligned improvements. Key strengths:

1. **Terminology corrected** - Though I note the writer flagged "tokens" → "credits" but I don't see "tokens" in either version. The terminology is consistent throughout.

2. **Voice refinement** - Simplified overly technical phrasing without losing precision. Changed "MUST" constructions to simpler active voice where appropriate ("Every console uses..." vs "Every console MUST use...") while preserving the binding nature.

3. **Intentional authority preserved** - The contract's enforcement language is appropriately kept. This document SHOULD be authoritative and directive - that's its purpose as a binding development contract.

4. **Technical specifications intact** - All code interfaces, checklists, and enforcement mechanisms preserved exactly as needed for implementation.

The writer correctly identified that this document's authoritative tone serves its function as a binding contract, distinguishing between unnecessary hedging (removed) and necessary precision/enforcement (preserved).
