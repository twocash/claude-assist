### Specific Feedback

Excellent rewrite that successfully transforms legacy content while preserving its strongest elements. The writer correctly identified and preserved the intentional uncertainty throughout Section 7 ("Honest Assessment") and other caveat sections—these contain appropriate hedging like "might," "may not," and "we do not know" that represents substantive intellectual honesty, not throat-clearing filler.

Key strengths:
- **Terminology precision**: Perfect execution of mappings (Tokens→Credits, "decentralized AI"→"distributed AI infrastructure", etc.)
- **Strategic alignment**: Successfully repositioned around "exploration architecture" framing
- **Technical accuracy**: Corrected Diary System references, Trellis Architecture alignment
- **Voice consistency**: Maintained Grove's confident-but-honest tone throughout
- **Structural integrity**: Preserved the document's persuasive flow while updating content

The writer appropriately flagged areas needing validation (economic projections, governance triggers, research citations) without attempting changes beyond their scope.

### Suggested Improvements (Optional)

Minor enhancement: Consider updating the Park et al. (2023) citation in the conclusion to reflect current year (2026) context, but this is not critical for PASS status.

The rewrite successfully demonstrates Grove's editorial standards in practice—strategic positioning without smugness, technical precision without jargon, and honest uncertainty acknowledgment without undermining confidence in the core thesis.
