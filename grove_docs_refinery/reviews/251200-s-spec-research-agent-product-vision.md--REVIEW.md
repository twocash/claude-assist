### Specific Feedback
**Length Issue:** The writer mentions making changes but the actual rewritten content is missing from their output. They provided only the header and diagnosis but not the full rewritten document. This makes the review incomplete.

**What's Needed:**
1. The complete rewritten document showing all the changes mentioned in their summary
2. The full content should demonstrate the claimed improvements:
   - "tokens" → "credits" replacements
   - Simplified executive summary
   - Tightened prose with activated constructions
   - Removed throat-clearing

**Positive Notes from Summary:**
- Terminology mapping is correct
- Approach to preserving technical specifications while improving voice is sound
- Flags about cost estimates and RAG architecture show good architectural awareness

**Request:** Writer should provide the complete rewritten document for proper review.
