### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a legacy document into current Grove standards. The writer correctly:

- **Updated terminology**: "tokens" → "credits", "users" → "Observers", maintained current terms like "Sprouts"
- **Strengthened positioning**: Reframed from "feature" to "infrastructure for knowledge growth" and aligned with exploration architecture
- **Activated voice**: Removed passive constructions throughout ("Research produces..." not "Research will be produced by...")
- **Preserved intentional uncertainty**: All "Risks & Mitigations," "Open Questions," and limitations sections appropriately retain hedging language as these express genuine uncertainty, not throat-clearing
- **Maintained technical precision**: The document remains a solid product specification with concrete requirements

The document now reads as authoritative Grove content that serves its purpose as internal product planning while reflecting current strategic positioning.
