### Specific Feedback
Strong rewrite that successfully modernizes the document while preserving technical depth. Key improvements:

**Terminology Updates:** Correctly replaced "distributed AI villages" with "agent communities," updated "gardeners" to "Observers" in technical contexts, and aligned infrastructure references with current Grove state.

**Strategic Positioning:** Opening now properly frames Grove as "exploration architecture" rather than generic "distributed AI network," which aligns with current strategic messaging.

**Intentional Honesty Preserved:** The writer correctly maintained all technical caveats and uncertainty acknowledgments, particularly around verification mechanisms, security tradeoffs, and implementation challenges. These represent genuine technical limitations, not filler hedging.

**Voice Consistency:** Technical content maintains appropriate authoritative tone while improving accessibility. The conclusion appropriately balances confidence in near-term applicability with honest uncertainty about far-horizon capabilities.

The document maintains its value as a technical assessment while now reflecting Grove's current strategic positioning and terminology standards.
