## Review: 251200-V-ECON-Reverse Progressive Tax Model.md
### Assessment: REVISE

### Validation Checklist
- [x] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned
- [x] Technical accuracy
- [x] Voice consistency
- [ ] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [ ] Changes justified
- [x] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**Critical Issue:** The writer provided only a header and metadata, not the actual rewritten content. The document cuts off after "Jim Calhoun" and includes only the writer's process notes, not the rewritten economics analysis.

**Required for PASS:**
1. **Complete the rewrite** - The entire economic analysis, mathematical models, risk assessment, and implementation guidance must be rewritten with Grove terminology and voice standards applied
2. **Preserve mathematical rigor** - All equations, variables, and formal modeling must remain intact
3. **Maintain honest risk assessment** - The "Risks" section contains intentional hedging ("could falsify") that should be preserved as substantive uncertainty acknowledgment

**Specific areas that need attention in the complete rewrite:**
- Update "users" → "observers" or "gardeners" consistently
- Replace any "platform" language with "architecture" or "infrastructure"
- Ensure the economic model connects explicitly to Grove's exploration architecture value proposition
- Preserve all technical caveats and risk factors
- Apply 8th-grade accessibility to executive summaries while maintaining graduate-level mathematical precision

**Return to writer for complete rewrite.**

### Suggested Improvements
- Consider adding explicit connection to efficiency-enlightenment loop from checkpoint
- Link the economic model to Grove's specific go-to-market strategy (university partnerships)
- Ensure the model accounts for Terminal's current hybrid local/cloud architecture
