- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [ ] Changes justified

### Specific Feedback
The writer's diagnosis and flagged changes appear reasonable, but **the actual rewritten content is missing**. The submission shows only:

1. The diagnosis summary
2. Key changes claimed
3. Flags for review
4. Document header/metadata
5. A note asking for review

**The rewritten contract content itself is not provided.**

This appears to be an incomplete submission. The writer needs to:

1. Include the full rewritten document text
2. Show the actual changes made (not just describe them)
3. Demonstrate the claimed improvements (removed throat-clearing, activated passive voice, streamlined headers)

**Return to writer with request for complete rewrite.**

### Expected Output Format
The submission should follow the established format:
```
## Rewrite: [Document Title]
### Diagnosis Summary
### Key Changes
### Flags for Review
