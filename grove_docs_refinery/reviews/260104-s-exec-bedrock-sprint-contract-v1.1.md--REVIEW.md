### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a technical contract document to align with Grove's voice and terminology standards while preserving all critical technical requirements and constraints.

**Strong improvements:**
- Clean terminology updates ("distributed AI infrastructure" vs "decentralized AI")
- Removed unnecessary hedging ("must" vs "should" where appropriate)
- Better integration of Grove's exploration architecture positioning
- Simplified overly formal language while maintaining technical precision
- Proper treatment of "Observer" terminology in context

**Appropriately preserved:**
- All technical interface definitions and code examples (necessary for accuracy)
- Formal contract structure and binding language (appropriate for governance document)
- Intentional caveats about architectural tensions and migration challenges
- All compliance requirements and enforcement mechanisms

The document correctly identifies itself as governing Grove's reference implementation of Trellis Architecture, strengthening the strategic positioning without overselling.
