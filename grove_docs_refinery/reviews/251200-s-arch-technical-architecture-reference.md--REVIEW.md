## Review: 251200-S-ARCH-Technical Architecture Reference.md
### Assessment: REVISE

### Validation Checklist
- [x] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned
- [x] Technical accuracy
- [x] Voice consistency
- [x] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [ ] Appropriate length
- [x] Changes justified
- [x] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**Major Issue: Incomplete Rewrite**
The writer's output contains only the header and copyright notice, not the full rewritten document. This appears to be a truncation issue rather than a completed rewrite.

**What Was Provided:**
- Document header updated correctly (exploration architecture positioning)
- Proper terminology fixes mentioned in summary
- Good diagnosis of source content
- Appropriate change summary

**What's Missing:**
- The actual rewritten content body
- All technical sections (architecture, cognition loops, hybrid routing, etc.)
- The full document that should follow the header

**Required Changes:**
1. Provide the complete rewritten document, not just the header
2. Ensure all technical sections are included and updated per the methodology
3. Apply the terminology mappings throughout the full content
4. Maintain the comprehensive technical detail while improving strategic framing

The diagnostic work appears sound and the planned changes align well with Grove standards, but the execution is incomplete. Please provide the full rewritten document for proper review.

### Suggested Improvements
- Strengthening the exploration vs. optimization distinction throughout technical sections
- Ensuring Journal system description reflects its role as primary engagement hook
- Validating that hybrid architecture explanation aligns with current Terminal implementation
