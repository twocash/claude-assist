### Assessment: PASS

### Validation Checklist
- [x] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned

- [x] Voice consistency
- [x] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [x] Changes justified
- [x] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
Document successfully updated to current Grove standards. Key improvements include:
- Clean terminology alignment (tokens→credits, users→Observers, etc.)
- Stronger positioning as "exploration architecture" rather than defensive framing
- Removed unnecessary hedging while preserving technical caveats
- Maintained all authoritative technical specifications
- Preserved honest uncertainty about network phases and capability timelines

The writer correctly preserved intentional uncertainty markers around capability projections ("What requires cloud today becomes local-capable within 21 months") and network architecture phases—this reflects genuine technical reality, not filler hedging.

### Suggested Improvements
- The "What Grove Is (and Is Not)" section could be strengthened further by leading with positive capabilities before mentioning what it's not
- Consider adding a brief mention of the Terminal interface at the-grove.ai in the opening section to connect with current live infrastructure
