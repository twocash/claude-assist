### Specific Feedback
The rewrite successfully transforms a solid tactical document into one that aligns with current Grove positioning. The writer preserved all the valuable university navigation insights while updating terminology and strategic framing. The addition of specific context about Dr. Chiang's Big Tech critique and Wayne Turner's litigation background strengthens the strategic foundation.

The document now clearly positions Grove as "exploration architecture" rather than generic "distributed AI systems" and emphasizes epistemic independence rather than just technological innovation. The university messaging framework shifts from generic tech partnership to institutional sovereignty, which is much stronger.
