### Specific Feedback
**PASS**: This document meets all Grove standards and is ready for use.

The rewrite successfully transforms a generic technical methodology into Grove-specific exploration infrastructure guidance. Key improvements:

1. **Strategic Framing**: Now positioned as "exploration infrastructure methodology" rather than generic sprint planning, aligning with Grove's core thesis.

2. **Terminology Updates**: Correctly updated to current Grove terms while preserving technical context where "Gardener" remains appropriate (the pruning/growth metaphor).

3. **Voice Consistency**: Removed hedging language while maintaining technical precision. The writing is confident and direct without being overselling.

4. **Grove Context**: Added specific connections to epistemic independence, Trellis Architecture, and exploration vs. optimization framing.

5. **Intentional Honesty Preserved**: The document appropriately acknowledges genuine uncertainties (e.g., "When returning to a project after weeks/months, baselines show the last known-good state") without filler hedging.
