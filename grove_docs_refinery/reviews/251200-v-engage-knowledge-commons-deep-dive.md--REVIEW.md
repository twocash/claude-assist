### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a solid but legacy-framed document into current Grove voice and positioning. The writer correctly:

**Preserved Intentional Honesty:** The "Honest Assessment" sections maintain appropriate hedging ("These defenses reduce but don't eliminate the risk") and "What We Don't Know Yet" acknowledges genuine uncertainty about governance transitions. This is substantive uncertainty acknowledgment, not filler.

**Updated Terminology Consistently:** All legacy terms properly mapped (Worldsmiths→Observers, tokens→credits, "The-Grove.ai"→Grove AI Foundation).

**Strengthened Strategic Positioning:** The conclusion now frames Grove as "exploration infrastructure" rather than generic "knowledge repository"—perfectly aligned with current positioning.

**Improved Voice:** Eliminated passive constructions ("Knowledge flows to wherever it creates value" vs. original "knowledge can be useful"), removed throat-clearing, activated language throughout.

**Maintained Technical Depth:** Complex attribution mechanisms and federated architecture details preserved while making prose more direct.

The document now serves as an excellent reference for Grove's knowledge sharing philosophy and technical approach, suitable for academic/research audiences while maintaining Grove's distinctive voice.
