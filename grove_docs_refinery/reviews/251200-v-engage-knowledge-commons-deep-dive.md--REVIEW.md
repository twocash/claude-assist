### Specific Feedback
**Primary Issue:** The writer flagged "Worldsmiths" terminology but didn't actually update it in the document body. The term appears multiple times and needs consistent replacement with current terminology per the checkpoint.

**Terminology Updates Needed:**
- "Worldsmiths" → "Observers" (as writer noted but didn't execute)
- "The-Grove.ai Foundation" → "Foundation" (partially done but inconsistent)
- "The Grove Knowledge Commons" → "Grove Knowledge Commons" (remove "The" for consistency)

**Secondary Issues:**
- The document body wasn't included in the submission - only diagnosis and flags. Need the full rewritten content to validate changes.
- Executive summary still contains legacy framing elements that could be strengthened.

**What's Working Well:**
- Writer correctly identified key terminology issues
- Preserved academic rigor and research citations
- Maintained intentional caveats in design tensions section
- Recognized need to strengthen exploration architecture positioning

Return to writer for completion of flagged terminology updates and submission of full rewritten document body.
