### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms dense academic prose into Grove's clear, active voice while preserving all substantive content and analytical rigor. The writer correctly identified this as an analytical document about external projects (Stargate), not a Grove positioning piece, and maintained appropriate terminology for that context.

**Excellent preservation of intentional uncertainty:** All probability estimates (40%, 60%, >75%) and risk assessments were correctly retained as these represent substantive research findings, not filler hedging. The "might," "could," and similar constructions that were removed were indeed throat-clearing, while legitimate uncertainty expressions in risk modeling sections were preserved.

**Strong voice activation:** The transformation from passive academic constructions ("The research leads to a singular, overarching conclusion") to active Grove voice ("Research leads to singular conclusion") significantly improves readability without losing authority.

**Appropriate scope boundaries:** The writer correctly left terms like "AGI" and "superintelligence" when analyzing external projects, and maintained academic citation integrity throughout.

### Suggested Improvements
- The document title could be shortened for better accessibility: "Capital, Cognition, and the Stargate Risk Assessment"
- Consider adding a brief Grove context note if this analysis informs Grove's strategic positioning, though the current framing as external analysis is also valid
