### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully maintains the document's analytical rigor while applying Grove voice standards. The writer correctly preserved all intentional hedging in risk assessment sections (probability calculations, uncertainty acknowledgments) while removing filler language elsewhere. The document's core value—rigorous quantitative analysis of societal risks from AI infrastructure concentration—remains intact.

Key strengths:
- Maintained all academic citations and quantitative frameworks unchanged
- Preserved intentional uncertainty language in probability modeling sections
- Removed buzzwords like "democratize" without compromising meaning
- Strengthened voice through active constructions and direct statements
- Document type (risk analysis) appropriately maintains third-person academic tone

The changes align with Grove's positioning on distributed vs. centralized infrastructure while respecting the document's original analytical framework.
