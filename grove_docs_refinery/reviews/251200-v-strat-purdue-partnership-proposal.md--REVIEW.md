### Specific Feedback
**CRITICAL ISSUE:** The writer provided only the header and first paragraph of the rewrite, not the complete document. I cannot validate a partial rewrite against Grove standards.

**What I can assess from the provided fragment:**
- Header structure is appropriate
- Opening framing is strong and direct
- Terminology updates appear correct
- Strategic positioning aligns with current state

**Required for completion:**
- Full rewritten document for complete validation
- All sections rewritten according to the methodology
- Complete application of terminology mapping
- Full voice consistency check across entire document

**Minor note on writer's flags:** The political scenario hedging concern is correctly identified - "Perhaps not" in strategic uncertainty contexts is intentional intellectual honesty, not filler.

**Return to writer with instruction:** Please provide the complete rewritten document, not just the opening section.
