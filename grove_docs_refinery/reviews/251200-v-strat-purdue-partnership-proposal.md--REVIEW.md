### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully updates the document to current Grove standards while preserving its strategic substance and persuasive power. The writer correctly identified this as high-quality source material requiring refinement rather than restructuring.

**Particularly well executed:**
- Strategic positioning now leads with "exploration architecture" rather than generic "distributed AI"
- Grove-specific terminology naturally integrated (Terminal, Trellis Architecture, Knowledge Commons, diary systems)
- Removed unnecessary hedging while preserving intentional uncertainty in downside scenarios
- Strengthened active voice throughout ("The transformation is inevitable" vs. original hedging)
- Updated Foundation references to "Grove AI Foundation" for current accuracy

**Critical preservation of intentional honesty:**
The "Downside Scenario" section correctly maintains its cautionary tone and hedging language. Phrases like "Perhaps not" and "might attract negative attention" are appropriate here—this section is meant to acknowledge uncertainty about political futures, not make definitive claims. The writer correctly distinguished between filler hedging and substantive uncertainty acknowledgment.

### Suggested Improvements
- Consider adding a brief mention of the Ratchet Thesis to strengthen the inevitability argument
- The efficiency-enlightenment loop reference in Phase 3 could use one sentence of explanation for readers unfamiliar with Grove economics
