### Specific Feedback
Document meets all Grove standards and is ready for use. The writer successfully updated legacy terminology while preserving the document's analytical rigor and intentional uncertainty acknowledgments. The addition of Grove-specific context in "The Path Forward" section appropriately connects the broader infrastructure argument to Grove's exploration architecture without overselling.
