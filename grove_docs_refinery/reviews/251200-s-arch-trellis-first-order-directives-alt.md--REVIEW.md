## Review: 251200-S-ARCH-Trellis First Order Directives Alt.md
### Assessment: PASS

### Validation Checklist
- [x] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned
- [x] Technical accuracy
- [x] Voice consistency
- [x] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [x] Changes justified
- [x] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
Document successfully updated to current Grove standards. The rewrite effectively:

- **Terminology alignment**: Properly replaced "DEX" with "exploration architecture" throughout while maintaining technical precision
- **Strategic positioning**: Updated core philosophy to match current "Models are seeds, architecture is soil" framing
- **Voice consistency**: Eliminated buzzwords and tightened prose while preserving authoritative technical tone
- **Technical accuracy**: All architectural concepts remain sound; no implementation details were altered inappropriately

The document maintains its role as technical specification while becoming more accessible. The three-layer abstraction explanation is clearer, and the Field examples align with current Grove focus areas.

### Suggested Improvements
- Consider updating the cross-reference filename `specs/exploration-object-model.ts` in section 9 to verify it matches current codebase structure
- The implementation roadmap phases could benefit from verification against current development priorities, but this doesn't impact the architectural principles documented here
