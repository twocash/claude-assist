### Validation Checklist
- [x] Terminology current

- [ ] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [ ] Changes justified
- [ ] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**Major Issues Requiring Revision:**

1. **Over-aggressive hedging removal created unnatural prose**
   - "Technology giants' $300 billion data center investments bet on one assumption" reads awkwardly
   - "User-simulation relationships define through asymmetry" is grammatically broken
   - "Grove addresses through aggressive archiving" missing articles throughout

2. **Lost clarity through excessive compression**
   - "Examine this as alternative success:" - unclear antecedent
   - "Both structurally improve worlds where AI infrastructure concentrates" - meaning obscured
   - The Ratchet section became nearly unreadable due to over-compression

3. **Inconsistent voice**
   - Mix of telegraph-style compression ("Networks self-run") and full sentences
   - Lost the authoritative but accessible tone Grove requires

4. **New errors introduced**
   - "Bets thousands of personal computer nodes build collective intelligence" - missing "that"
   - "Whether Isabella reconciled with Maria, whether harvests succeeded" - awkward parallel structure
   - Multiple grammatical issues from aggressive editing

**What Worked Well:**
- Terminology updates were accurate and complete
- "Exploration architecture" positioning properly integrated
- Intentional hedging preserved in Technical Constraints section
- Horse metaphor streamlined effectively

**Required Changes:**
1. Restore grammatical correctness throughout
2. Balance compression with clarity - don't sacrifice readability for brevity
3. Maintain consistent voice that's professional but accessible
4. Fix the over-compressed sections, particularly in "The Ratchet"
5. Ensure all sentences are complete and clear

The core editorial work is sound, but the execution went too far in removing necessary words for clarity and flow. Grove's voice should be "8th-grade accessibility, graduate-level thinking" - not telegraphic compression.
