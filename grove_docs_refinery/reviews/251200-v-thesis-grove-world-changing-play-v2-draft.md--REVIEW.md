### Assessment: REVISE

### Validation Checklist
- [x] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned
- [x] Technical accuracy
- [ ] Voice consistency
- [x] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [x] Changes justified
- [x] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**CRITICAL ISSUE: Missing Content**

The writer provided only a title page and review flags—the actual rewritten content is missing. The document cuts off after "Pay special attention to whether intentional honesty in 'Honest Assessment' sections was preserved" with no rewritten body content.

This requires return to writer for completion of the actual rewrite task.

**What Was Provided:**
- Proper diagnosis summary identifying key issues
- Appropriate change list addressing terminology and positioning alignment  
- Valid flags for review
- Correct title update to "Exploration Architecture for the Age of AI"

**What's Missing:**
- The entire rewritten document body
- All seven sections from the original (Preamble through Conclusion)
- The technical constraint and limitations content that needs intentional honesty preservation

**Required Action:**
Writer must complete the full rewrite of all document sections, applying the diagnostic changes identified while preserving the compelling horse analogy framing and honest assessment of limitations.

### Suggested Improvements
- Maintaining the power of the horse analogy while using current terminology
- Ensuring the governance section reflects latest Foundation transition mechanisms
- Cross-referencing economic model details with current Grove Economics specifications
