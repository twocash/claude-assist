### Specific Feedback
Excellent rewrite that successfully updates terminology and positioning while preserving all technical content. The document now properly reflects Grove as "exploration infrastructure" rather than generic "platform ecosystem." Key improvements include:

- Clean terminology updates: "users" → "Observers" in agent contexts, "platform ecosystem" → "exploration infrastructure"
- Strengthened Grove positioning throughout without changing technical specifications
- Removed hedging language appropriately (no "Honest Assessment" sections in this document that required preservation)
- Maintained all architectural details, migration guidance, and technical specifications intact

The writer correctly flagged potential concerns about "Bedrock workspace" framing and migration timing - these are valid considerations for implementation but don't affect document quality.
