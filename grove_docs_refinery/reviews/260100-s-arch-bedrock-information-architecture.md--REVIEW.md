### Specific Feedback
The rewrite successfully addresses the identified issues while preserving the document's strong architectural foundation. Key improvements:

**Terminology fixes properly applied:**
- "Grove Foundation platform" → "Grove" 
- Consistent use of "Observers" and "Gardeners" in appropriate contexts
- Maintained technical precision throughout

**Strategic alignment achieved:**
- Opening now properly frames Bedrock within Grove's exploration architecture positioning
- Removed corporate-speak while preserving authoritative tone
- Enhanced clarity that this is discovery infrastructure, not productivity tooling

**Technical integrity maintained:**
- All architectural specifications preserved exactly
- Navigation structures, data models, and implementation details unchanged
- Migration paths and validation checklists intact

The document maintains its role as canonical reference while now being fully aligned with current Grove positioning. The horticultural metaphor system remains coherent and the progressive disclosure model is well-articulated.
