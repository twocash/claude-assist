### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a strong technical document from academic positioning to Grove's exploration architecture framing. Key improvements include:

- **Strategic Alignment**: Opening now positions this as "exploration infrastructure" rather than generic "distributed AI agents"
- **Terminology Updates**: Clean conversion to Grove terms (agents vs LLMs, locally-intelligent vs distributed, Ratchet effect capitalized)
- **Voice Improvement**: Maintains technical depth while adopting Grove's accessible-yet-sophisticated tone
- **Honest Assessment Preservation**: Technical limitations and trade-offs remain clearly stated (Mamba retrieval struggles, quadratic scaling problems, memory degradation issues)

The writer correctly preserved intentional uncertainty in sections discussing architectural trade-offs and system limitations, which is appropriate technical honesty rather than filler hedging.

### Suggested Improvements
- Consider adding a brief exploration-specific example in the Princeton section to demonstrate how neuro-symbolic separation specifically benefits discovery vs optimization tasks
- The Princeton collaboration mention in flags should be verified, but doesn't affect the technical content quality
