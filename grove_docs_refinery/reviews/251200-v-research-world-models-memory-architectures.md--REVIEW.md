### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully updates the document to Grove standards. The writer correctly identified the main issues (legacy terminology, generic AI positioning) and addressed them while preserving the strong technical content. The opening reframe from "distributed AI agents" to "exploration infrastructure" aligns perfectly with current positioning. Technical recommendations remain sound and the research synthesis adds genuine value.

The document appropriately maintains technical caveats and uncertainty where substantive (e.g., "trade-offs," "different approaches for different purposes") while eliminating filler hedging. Research citations and benchmarks appear current and well-integrated.
