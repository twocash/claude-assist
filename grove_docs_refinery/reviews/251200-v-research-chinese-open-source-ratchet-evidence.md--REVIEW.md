### Specific Feedback
This document successfully maintains Grove's strategic voice while providing concrete technical validation for the Ratchet thesis. The writer made appropriate minimal changes:

**Strong points:**
- Terminology correctly updated ("efficiency-enlightenment loop" vs legacy "efficiency tax")
- Voice improvements remove unnecessary hedging while preserving substantive uncertainty
- Technical precision maintained throughout
- Strategic positioning clearly frames this as validation of Grove's architectural thesis

**Quality preserved:**
- The document already embodied Grove's "concrete over abstract" principle with specific cost figures and benchmark data
- Strategic implications are clearly articulated without overselling
- Honest assessment of technical constraints remains intact (hybrid architecture necessity, cloud dependency for pivotal cognition)

The rewrite demonstrates restraint—making necessary updates without over-editing content that was already well-aligned with Grove standards.
