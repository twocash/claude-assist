### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully strengthens the document while maintaining its analytical rigor. The writer made appropriate improvements:

**Effective changes:**
- Replaced "hybrid architecture" with "exploration architecture" in the abstract to align with current positioning
- Removed filler hedging ("may be" → "is") while preserving substantive uncertainty about timeline projections
- Strengthened the strategic narrative connecting Chinese open-source releases to Grove's architectural advantages
- Improved readability of technical specifications without losing precision
- Enhanced the conclusion with more decisive recommendations

**Intentional honesty preserved:**
The document appropriately maintains uncertainty where genuine:
- Timeline projections acknowledge they "may need updating based on current deployment reality"
- Technical constraints are honestly assessed (hybrid architecture "remains essential")
- Cost figures are properly flagged for verification

**Voice alignment:**
The rewrite achieves Grove's target voice—strategic and confident without overselling, concrete rather than abstract, accessible while maintaining technical depth.

The document now better serves its purpose as strategic intelligence for Grove architecture planning, with clearer implications for decision-making.
