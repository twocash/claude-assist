### Specific Feedback
Document meets Grove standards and is ready for use. The writer correctly identified this as an internal methodology document that needed minimal strategic repositioning. The key terminology update from "Grove Terminal" to "Terminal" aligns with current checkpoint standards. The voice strengthening is appropriate - more confident and Grove-aligned while preserving all technical specificity required for an operational methodology.
