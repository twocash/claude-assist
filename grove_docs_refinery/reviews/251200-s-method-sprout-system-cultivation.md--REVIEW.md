- [ ] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [ ] Changes justified
- [x] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**Major Issue: Document Length Mismatch**
The writer submitted only an abstract when the source document is a comprehensive 9-section technical specification (~3,000 words). This appears to be a misunderstanding of the task scope rather than a complete rewrite.

**What Was Done Well:**
- Terminology updates are accurate ("exploration architecture," "agents")
- Abstract positioning is strong and Grove-aligned
- Academic audience framing is appropriate
- Core concept capture is clear

**What Needs Completion:**
The source document contains substantial technical architecture that wasn't addressed:
- The recursive loop mechanism (Section 1)
- Botanical lifecycle terminology (Section 2) 
- Detailed provenance specification (Section 3)
- UX flow descriptions (Section 4)
- Protocol generalization discussion (Section 5)
- MVP vs. future capabilities breakdown (Section 6)
- Research questions for university partners (Section 8)

**Specific Revisions Needed:**
1. **Complete the rewrite** - Address all 9 sections of the source document
2. **Preserve technical depth** - Universities need implementation details, not just concept overview
3. **Maintain research questions** - Section 8 is valuable for academic partnerships
4. **Keep protocol perspective** - Section 5's generalization aligns with Grove's infrastructure positioning

**Minor Language Issues:**
- "Users capture" → "Observers capture" (in agent-facing contexts)
- Consider whether "productivity optimization" contrast needs strengthening
