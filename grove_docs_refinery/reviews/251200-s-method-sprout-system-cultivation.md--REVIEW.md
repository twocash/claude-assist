### Specific Feedback
Document successfully transforms from academic draft to Grove technical specification. Key improvements:

**Strong Alignment:**
- "Exploration architecture" framing replaces generic "collective intelligence"
- Clean terminology updates (chatbot → agent, LLM → Agent, users → Observers)
- Voice shift from academic hedging to confident technical specification
- Strategic positioning now reflects Grove's current thesis about exploration vs. optimization

**Technical Integrity Maintained:**
- TypeScript interfaces preserved verbatim (appropriate for spec document)
- Field architecture and provenance chains accurately described
- MVP vs. Future phases clearly delineated

**Intentional Honesty Preserved:**
- Section 8 "Research Questions" appropriately maintains uncertainty about empirical outcomes
- Future capabilities honestly acknowledged as dependent on infrastructure development
- Caveats about attribution economy stress-testing implied but not overstated
