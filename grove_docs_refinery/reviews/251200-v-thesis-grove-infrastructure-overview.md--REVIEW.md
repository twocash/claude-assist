### Assessment: REVISE

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned

- [x] Voice consistency
- [ ] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [x] Appropriate length
- [ ] Changes justified

### Specific Feedback
**Critical Issue**: The writer did not provide the actual rewritten content. The output shows only:

```
# Grove: Exploration Architecture for Distributed Intelligence

---

Please review this rewrite against Grove standards.
Pay special attention to whether intentional honesty in "Honest Assessment" sections was preserved.
```

This appears to be incomplete - just a title and meta-instructions rather than the full rewritten document.

**Required for PASS**: The writer must provide the complete rewritten document showing all the changes mentioned in their summary:
- Updated terminology mappings
- Alignment with "exploration architecture" framing  
- Removal of buzzwords and throat-clearing
- Voice consistency improvements
- All content sections rewritten per Grove standards

**Note on Methodology**: The writer's diagnostic approach was sound - they correctly identified legacy terminology, positioning issues, and voice problems in the source. However, without the actual rewrite, I cannot validate whether these fixes were properly implemented.

### Suggested Improvements
- Ensuring the "Honest Assessment" section's intentional hedging is preserved
- Verifying the economic model explanation uses current Grove terminology
- Confirming the technical architecture description matches hybrid cognition framing
