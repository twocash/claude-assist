### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a solid but inconsistent source document into Grove-standard content. The writer correctly identified and fixed the key issues:

**Excellent terminology cleanup**: All instances of "tokens" replaced with "credits," crypto signaling removed, and current Grove terminology properly applied throughout.

**Strong voice consistency**: The manifesto-style sections now read with appropriate confidence while the technical sections maintain precision. The hedging removal strengthened claims without losing substantive content.

**Intentional honesty properly preserved**: The "Honest Assessment" section retains all necessary hedging language ("*don't* catch up," "remain possible," "might*"). This is exactly right—these are substantive uncertainties being acknowledged, not throat-clearing filler.

**Strategic positioning enhanced**: The shift from generic "distributed intelligence" to Grove's specific "exploration architecture" thesis comes through clearly, especially in the abstract and conclusion.

**Technical accuracy maintained**: All architectural descriptions align with current Grove specifications and checkpoint references.

The document now effectively serves its purpose as a comprehensive infrastructure overview that positions Grove as exploration architecture rather than generic AI distribution.

### Suggested Improvements
- The "Horse Moment" conclusion is provocative and effective for the manifesto genre, though some audiences might find it overly dramatic. Consider context when deploying.
- Section 5.1 uses "Gardeners" while the writer noted this as potentially inconsistent with "Observers"—this appears intentional as gardening metaphor works specifically for the UX context, distinct from agent-facing "Observer" terminology.
