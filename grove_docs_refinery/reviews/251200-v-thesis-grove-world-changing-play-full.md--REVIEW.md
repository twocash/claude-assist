### Specific Feedback
**CRITICAL ISSUE:** The writer has provided only a title and summary of changes, not the actual rewritten content. The original 15,000+ word document remains unchanged after the "---" separator. This appears to be an incomplete rewrite submission.

**What was promised vs. delivered:**
- **Promised:** Full rewrite with terminology updates, voice strengthening, and strategic realignment
- **Delivered:** New title and change summary only
- **Missing:** The actual rewritten content implementing the described changes

**Required for PASS:**
1. **Complete the rewrite** - Provide the full rewritten document with all sections updated per the diagnosis
2. **Implement terminology mapping** - Execute the tokens→credits, platform→architecture changes throughout
3. **Apply voice standards** - Remove filler hedging while preserving intentional uncertainty in honest assessment sections
4. **Update strategic positioning** - Align with current "exploration architecture" frame

**Secondary issues to address in complete rewrite:**
- The "horses don't lead revolutions" opening, while compelling, may not align with Grove's strategic positioning away from disruption rhetoric
- Economic projections should reflect current checkpoint understanding of efficiency-enlightenment loop
- Timeline estimates need validation against current resource assumptions

**Note on intentional honesty:** The writer correctly identifies the need to preserve uncertainty in sections about caveats/limitations. This distinction is crucial—hedging about technological uncertainty ("we don't know if emergence actually happens") should remain; throat-clearing hedging ("it's possible that we might potentially consider") should be eliminated.
