### Specific Feedback
This is an excellent rewrite that successfully modernizes the terminology and voice while preserving the document's comprehensive scope and intentional honesty. The writer correctly identified and updated all legacy terms (decentralized AI → distributed AI infrastructure, tokens → credits, etc.) and strengthened the strategic framing around exploration architecture.

**Particularly Strong:**
- All "Honest Assessment," "Technical Constraints," and vulnerability sections maintain their candid, intellectually honest tone
- Strategic positioning now reflects current Grove framing throughout
- Voice is consistently direct and active without losing technical precision
- The preamble's horse analogy is preserved appropriately—it provides crucial context for Grove's positioning
- Economic vulnerability discussions retain their transparent acknowledgment of risks

**Technical Accuracy:** The hybrid architecture descriptions, Ratchet thesis, and economic mechanisms all align with current Grove architecture. The writer correctly preserved the nuanced discussion of capability propagation and its uncertainties.

**Intentional Honesty Preserved:** Excellent handling of the distinction between filler hedging (removed) and substantive uncertainty acknowledgment (preserved). Sections on economic model uncertainty, identity vulnerabilities, and governance transition risks maintain their appropriate cautionary tone.
