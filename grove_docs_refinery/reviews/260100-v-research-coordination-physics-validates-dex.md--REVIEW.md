### Specific Feedback
The rewrite successfully transforms a solid academic document into exemplary Grove content. Key strengths:

**Terminology precision**: Correctly updated "tokens" to "credits" and aligned all language with current checkpoint standards.

**Voice transformation**: Eliminated filler hedging ("might," "could potentially") while preserving substantive intellectual honesty. The caveats about scaling limitations and coordination thresholds maintain appropriate uncertainty without throat-clearing.

**Strengthened argumentation**: Transformed weak constructions ("This finding directly validates" vs. "This finding could potentially validate") into confident assertions backed by evidence.

**Academic rigor maintained**: Preserved all citations, formulas, and technical specifics appropriate for a research brief while improving accessibility.

The document correctly distinguishes between prohibited hedging (filler language) and legitimate intellectual honesty (acknowledging research limitations, systemic risks, and areas of uncertainty). The "Epistemic Capture Risk" and "Tech Monoculture" sections properly maintain hedging where substantive uncertainty exists.
