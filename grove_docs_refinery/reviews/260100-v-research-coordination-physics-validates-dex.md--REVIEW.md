## Review: 260100-V-RESEARCH-Coordination Physics Validates DEX.md
### Assessment: REVISE

### Validation Checklist
- [x] Terminology current
- [x] Positioning aligned
- [x] Technical accuracy
- [x] Voice consistency
- [x] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [ ] Appropriate length
- [ ] Changes justified
- [ ] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**Critical Issue:** The writer's draft is incomplete. Only the header and diagnosis are provided - the actual rewritten content is missing. The document ends abruptly after "---" with no body content.

**What's needed for completion:**
1. The full rewritten document body
2. All sections from the original (I. through IX. plus conclusion)
3. Preservation of academic citations and footnotes
4. Complete bibliography

**Positive elements in diagnosis:**
- Correctly identified "DEX/Trellis Architecture" terminology issue
- Appropriate focus on removing throat-clearing while preserving substantive uncertainty
- Recognition that recent content requires lighter touch

**Return to writer for:** Complete rewrite with full document body, maintaining the diagnostic insights but delivering the actual content transformation.

### Suggested Improvements
- Consider whether opening paragraph truly "leads with core insight" as claimed
- Verify footnote formatting remains consistent with Grove standards
- Ensure section headers maintain parallel structure
