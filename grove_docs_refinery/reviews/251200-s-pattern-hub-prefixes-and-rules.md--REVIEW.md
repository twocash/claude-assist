### Specific Feedback
The writer made appropriate terminology updates and strategic alignment changes, but the rewrite is **incomplete and raises structural questions** that require return to writer:

**Major Issues:**
1. **Incomplete rewrite** - The writer provided only a header change and diagnosis, but the document contains extensive prompt instructions that need full rewriting, not just a title change.

2. **Structural mismatch** - This appears to be internal prompt engineering documentation, not a public-facing Grove document. The entire multi-prompt architecture (Prompts 1-5) needs assessment: should this be rewritten to match current Grove standards, or is this internal tooling that operates by different rules?

3. **Content scope unclear** - The document contains detailed instructions for writing "the definitive white paper" with specific voice banks, source hierarchies, and execution commands. The writer needs to clarify whether this entire instruction set should be updated to current Grove standards.

**Specific Required Changes:**
- Complete the rewrite of all prompt instructions, not just the header
- Update all voice examples in the "Voice Bank" section to current Grove standards
- Revise the source hierarchy to reflect current canonical documents per checkpoint
- Update the master outline to reflect current Grove positioning
- Clarify whether internal prompt engineering docs should follow same standards as external content

**Minor Issues:**
- The provenance section contains outdated namespace conventions that should be updated

**Return to writer** for complete rewrite with clarification on scope and purpose of this document within Grove's content ecosystem.
