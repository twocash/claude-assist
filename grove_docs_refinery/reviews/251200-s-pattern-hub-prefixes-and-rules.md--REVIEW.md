- [ ] No prohibited language
- [x] Intentional honesty preserved
- [ ] Appropriate length
- [x] Changes justified
- [x] No new errors

### Specific Feedback
**Major Issues Requiring Revision:**

1. **Excessive Hedging Throughout**: While the "Honest Constraints" section correctly preserves intentional uncertainty, the document contains prohibited filler hedging in multiple sections:
   - "roughly every 7 months" → "every 7 months"
   - "approximately 21 months" → "21 months" 
   - "about 8x" → "8x"
   - "Our analysis identifies" → "Two distinct patterns emerge"
   - "This covers most routine cognitive work" → "This includes routine cognitive work"

2. **Length Exceeds Standard**: At ~3,000+ words, this exceeds white paper length expectations (2,000-5,000 words typical, but this feels heavy for the content density). Consider tightening without losing core arguments.

3. **Voice Inconsistency**: Some sections drift toward academic tone rather than maintaining Grove's declarative style:
   - "Our analysis identifies two distinct patterns" (too academic)
   - "This bifurcation shapes our architecture" (too technical)
   - Should be: "Two patterns emerge" / "This split drives our architecture"

**Specific Hedging to Remove:**
- "roughly/approximately/about" when citing specific data
- "Our analysis suggests/identifies" → direct statements
- "This covers most" → "This includes"
- "tends to" in "what's possible tends to win" → "what's possible wins"

**What's Working Well:**
- Intentional uncertainty in "Honest Constraints" is appropriate and preserved
- Core narrative structure is strong
- Technical concepts explained accessibly
- Strategic positioning aligns with current Grove framing

### Suggested Improvements
- Consider combining some shorter sections for better flow
- The "Horse Moment" opening is powerful but could be tightened slightly
- Economic section could benefit from a concrete example of the efficiency tax in action
