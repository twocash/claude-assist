### Specific Feedback
**Critical Issue: Missing Content**
The rewrite appears incomplete. You've provided only the title and header information, not the full rewritten document. The original source is ~3,000 words but your output stops after the metadata.

**Positioning Misalignment** 
Your diagnosis mentions updating the framing from "simulation-to-service transition" to "exploration architecture," which is correct. However, I cannot validate this change since the rewritten content is missing.

**Required Changes:**
1. **Complete the rewrite** - Provide the full rewritten document content
2. **Verify exploration architecture framing** - Ensure the opening clearly positions Grove as "exploration architecture" rather than utility-first AI infrastructure
3. **Confirm terminology updates** - Validate all instances of legacy terms have been updated per your diagnosis

**What's Working:**
- Your diagnosis correctly identifies key issues (terminology, hedging, positioning)
- The planned changes align with Grove standards
- Recognition that research citations should remain unchanged
- Appropriate preservation of intentional hedging in constraints sections

**Next Steps:**
Please provide the complete rewritten document. The current submission cannot be properly reviewed as it contains only headers and metadata.
