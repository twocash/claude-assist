### Specific Feedback
**PASS**: This document meets all Grove standards and is ready for use. The writer successfully aligned terminology with current standards while preserving the document's technical depth and research-grounded approach.

Key improvements validated:
- Clean terminology mapping (credits→Credits, villages→agent communities, users→Observers)
- Strengthened voice throughout non-caveat sections
- Proper preservation of intentional hedging in "Honest Constraints" section
- Alignment with "exploration architecture" framing
- Removal of throat-clearing without losing substance

The "Honest Constraints" section correctly maintains its hedging language ("may be wrong," "might," "won't") as this represents genuine intellectual honesty about risks and limitations, not filler language.

### Suggested Improvements
- Research citation dates (2025) align well with the checkpoint timeline
- The balance between technical detail and accessibility is appropriate for the developer audience
- Document structure and flow remain strong from the original
