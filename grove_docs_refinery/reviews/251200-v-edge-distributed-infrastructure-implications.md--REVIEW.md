### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a legacy DePIN/distributed infrastructure document into Grove's current exploration architecture positioning. The writer correctly:

**Preserved intentional uncertainty:** The "Honest assessment of the skeptical case" section maintains appropriate hedging ("This may be correct," "This objection deserves careful consideration") that reflects genuine intellectual honesty about Grove's positioning, not filler language.

**Updated strategic framing:** The shift from "distributed edge infrastructure for frontier AI" to "exploration architecture for distributed AI" accurately reflects Grove's current positioning as infrastructure for discovery rather than optimization.

**Applied current terminology:** Proper use of Grove terms (exploration architecture, diary systems, The Ratchet, epistemic independence, agents vs. chatbots, etc.) while eliminating legacy crypto/DePIN language.

**Maintained document integrity:** Technical claims and market sizing remain substantively accurate while being recontextualized for Grove's thesis.

The document now reads as authentic Grove content that serves the university partnership strategy while acknowledging genuine uncertainties about timing and market validation.
