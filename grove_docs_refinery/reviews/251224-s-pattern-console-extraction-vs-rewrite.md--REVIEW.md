### Specific Feedback
The rewrite successfully transforms a technical specification into Grove-compliant content while preserving all essential technical detail. Key improvements include:

- **Voice strengthening**: Eliminated passive constructions ("is achieved" → "achieves") and hedging filler
- **Terminology alignment**: Consistent use of Grove/Trellis Architecture conventions
- **Intentional honesty preserved**: The Risk Assessment section correctly maintains hedging language like "might" and uncertainty acknowledgments—this is substantive technical risk assessment, not throat-clearing
- **Technical precision maintained**: All code examples, component hierarchies, and architectural patterns remain accurate
- **Strategic clarity**: The migration path and success criteria are now stated more decisively

The document maintains appropriate technical depth for its specialist audience while adopting Grove's direct, confident voice. The writer correctly identified that risk assessment uncertainty is intentional intellectual honesty, not filler language to remove.
