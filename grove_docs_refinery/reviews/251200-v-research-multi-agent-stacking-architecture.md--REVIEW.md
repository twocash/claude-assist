### Specific Feedback
The rewrite is incomplete - only the title and header were provided. The writer appears to have started the rewrite but didn't include the actual rewritten content body. 

What I can assess from the diagnosis summary shows good editorial instincts:
- Appropriate terminology updates identified
- Clear connection to Grove's exploration architecture
- Removal of buzzwords
- Connection to DEX principles

However, I need to see the complete rewritten document to validate:
1. Whether the "Research Terms to Explore" section properly uses current Grove terminology
2. How the "Grove Relevance" section was strengthened with exploration architecture framing
3. Whether the research findings are positioned as inputs to Grove's agent coordination thinking rather than generic "multi-agent systems" content
4. Appropriate length for a research capture document

### Required Action
Writer needs to provide the complete rewritten content body, not just the diagnosis summary and header.
