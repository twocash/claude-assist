### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms a generic AI research note into content that validates Grove's architectural choices. The writer correctly:

- Reframes "stacking" as validation of Grove's hybrid architecture rather than just another AI technique
- Uses current Grove terminology throughout (DEX, Observer, exploration architecture, efficiency-enlightenment loop)
- Connects research patterns directly to Grove's design philosophy
- Maintains authoritative voice without overselling
- Preserves technical accuracy while making strategic connections explicit

The document now serves Grove's strategic positioning by showing how external research validates architectural decisions, rather than just cataloging interesting AI patterns.
