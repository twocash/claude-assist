### Specific Feedback
This is a clean rewrite that successfully applies Grove voice standards to technical methodology content. The writer correctly:

- Removed throat-clearing opening ("A structured methodology for") and led with direct value
- Tightened prose throughout while preserving all technical precision
- Made appropriate terminology updates ("Observer" in Grove contexts)
- Maintained technical standards and frameworks that are industry conventions (INVEST, Gherkin, etc.)
- Preserved all functional templates and examples as working specifications

The document doesn't contain "Honest Assessment" sections requiring hedging preservation—it's a technical methodology with objective criteria and procedures. The writer appropriately maintained certainty where the process is well-defined.
