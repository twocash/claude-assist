### Specific Feedback
This rewrite successfully transforms legacy positioning into current Grove standards. The writer correctly:

- **Repositioned from "distributed intelligence network" to "exploration architecture"** - This aligns perfectly with current strategic framing
- **Updated all terminology** - "Credits" not "tokens," "Observers" not "users," proper capitalization of Grove terms
- **Preserved intentional hedging in uncertainty sections** - The "Honest Assessment of Challenges" and "Critical Uncertainties" sections appropriately maintain "might," "could," and similar language because they're acknowledging genuine unknowns, not throat-clearing
- **Eliminated filler hedging** - Removed unnecessary qualifiers while keeping substantive uncertainty acknowledgments
- **Strengthened exploration vs. optimization positioning** - This is now clear throughout
- **Added university consortium context** - Appropriate integration of Purdue/academic focus
- **Maintained honest assessment of governance transition challenges** - Good preservation of Asparouhova critique awareness

The voice is consistently Grove-appropriate: confident without overselling, concrete over abstract, accessible but sophisticated. Technical accuracy is maintained while updating strategic framing.
