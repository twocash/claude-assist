# User Story Refinery v1

Transform requirements specifications into testable user stories with acceptance criteria. Produces review-ready story documents, flags clunky flows, proposes simplifications, and prepares for downstream test generation.

**Four-Phase Pipeline:**
1. **Story Extraction** — Parse spec into INVEST-assessed user stories
2. **Acceptance Criteria** — Gherkin scenarios for each story
3. **Test Case Generation** — Derive test cases from criteria (Phase 3)
4. **Playwright Scaffolding** — Generate test file structure (Phase 4)

This skill covers Phases 1-2. Phases 3-4 are downstream execution.
