# The Ratchet: Quantitative Analysis

## How AI Capability Propagation Creates Inevitable Value for Exploration Architecture

---

## The Strategic Insight

Grove's exploration architecture captures AI improvements as they flow from frontier to local models. This isn't speculation—six years of empirical data reveal a predictable propagation pattern that Grove's infrastructure exploits.

While others spend billions chasing the frontier, Grove inherits their advances automatically. The architecture matters more than the models.

---

## The Evidence Base

**METR Research (March 2025)**: "Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks"

- Task completion capability doubles every **7 months**
- Pattern holds across **6 years** with high statistical confidence
- Current frontier (Claude 3.7 Sonnet): ~1 hour tasks at 50% reliability

**Google Research (December 2025)**: Titans + MIRAS architectures

- Test-time memorization enables 2M+ credit context windows
- Proves frontier continues advancing—new capabilities for local models to inherit

## Model 1: The Propagation Timeline

Local models lag frontier capabilities by ~21 months (3 doubling cycles). This conservative estimate aligns with observed reality: GPT-4's capabilities (March 2023) now run on Llama 3.1 8B quantized (late 2024).

| Date | Frontier Capability | Local Capability | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dec 2025 | 1 hour | 8 minutes | 8x |
| Dec 2026 | 3.3 hours | 25 minutes | 8x |
| Nov 2027 | 10.8 hours | 1.3 hours | 8x |
| Nov 2028 | 1.5 days | 4.4 hours | 8x |
| Nov 2029 | 4.8 days | 14.5 hours | 8x |

**The gap ratio remains constant.** Both frontier and local advance, but the relationship stays fixed. Grove's hybrid architecture exploits this permanence—cloud handles today's frontier, local manages yesterday's capabilities.

---

## Model 2: Cognitive Enhancement Economics

Grove's cognitive enhancement mechanism (via credits) bridges the gap between local capability and exploration requirements. As local models improve, fewer explorations require cloud augmentation.

**Scenario**: Tasks requiring ~4 hours of coherent exploration (complex Journal synthesis, emergent theological debates)

| Date | Local Capability | Cloud Dependency | Credit Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dec 2025 | 8 min | 97% | High |
| Dec 2026 | 25 min | 90% | Moderate |
| Nov 2027 | 1.3 hrs | 66% | Low |
| Nov 2028 | 4.4 hrs | 0% | None |

**Credit costs decrease because the system works.** Early participants fund the bridge while the capability gap remains wide. This creates natural network effects—early adopters subsidize infrastructure that becomes increasingly valuable.

---

## Model 3: Infrastructure Value Comparison

**Centralized approach**: Continuous investment required to maintain frontier position. Assuming $50B/year base capex growing 20% annually.

**Ratchet approach**: Captures capability improvements from external R&D without funding research directly.

| Timeline | Centralized Cumulative CapEx | Ratchet Value Multiplier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12 months | $110B | 2.3x starting value |
| 24 months | $182B | 5.3x starting value |
| 36 months | $268B | 12.1x starting value |
| 48 months | $372B | 27.9x starting value |
| 60 months | $496B | 64.0x starting value |

**Grove converts competitors' R&D into network value.** While centralized players burn billions maintaining position, Grove's exploration architecture inherits their advances through open-weight model propagation.

---

## Model 4: Compound Value Creation

```
Grove Network Value = N(t) × C(t) × I(t)

Where:
  N(t) = Network size (agents/communities)
  C(t) = Capability per agent
  I(t) = Accumulated collective intelligence

```

**The critical insight**: C(t) grows from **external** R&D investments.

- Google develops Titans/MIRAS → capabilities reach local models
- Anthropic improves Claude → open-weight models narrow the gap
- Meta releases Llama updates → Grove agents upgrade automatically

The Grove builds exploration architecture, not AI models. The infrastructure captures value from others' research investments.

---

## Model 5: Capability Milestones

When local models achieve key Grove capabilities:

| Capability | Hours Required | Local Achieves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compelling Diary entries | 0.5 hrs | Feb 2027 |
| Multi-agent coordination | 2.0 hrs | Mar 2028 |
| Complex social dynamics | 4.0 hrs | Oct 2028 |
| Emergent theology | 8.0 hrs | May 2029 |
| Full agent autonomy | 168 hrs | Dec 2031 |

**The hybrid architecture isn't permanent**—it bridges to a future where local agents handle everything Grove envisions. The exploration architecture endures; the implementation evolves.

---

## Strategic Numbers

1. **7 months**: Capability doubling time (METR, 6-year validated pattern)
2. **21 months**: Frontier-to-local propagation lag
3. **8x**: Persistent capability gap ratio
4. **$300B+**: Announced centralized AI infrastructure investments
5. **$0**: Grove's required R&D spend to capture improvements
6. **Oct 2028**: Local models handle sophisticated agent dynamics

---

## Implementation Phases

**Foundation Phase (2025-2026)**: Hybrid architecture essential. Local models can't generate complex emergence. Cloud augmentation justified and necessary.

**Expansion Phase (2027-2028)**: Local handles most current capabilities. Cloud reserved for frontier explorations. Credit costs decline naturally.

**Maturity Phase (2029+)**: Local agents manage all currently envisioned capabilities. Grove's value shifts to network effects, accumulated intelligence, and governance infrastructure.

**Timing matters**: First-mover advantage compounds. Network effects × capability improvements × time creates widening competitive separation.

---

## Honest Assessment: Sensitivity Analysis

**What if capability doubling slows?**

- 10 months instead of 7 → milestones shift ~18 months later
- The Ratchet still functions, just slower
- Credit requirements persist longer (potentially more revenue, but also more dependence)

**What if propagation lag increases?**

- 30 months instead of 21 → local capability arrives later
- Cloud dependency extends
- Doesn't break the mechanism, but changes economics

**What if open-weight models stop improving?**

- Requires coordinated cessation by Meta, Mistral, and others
- Regulatory risk exists but current trend shows acceleration
- Grove's architecture functions with any local capability level, just differently

**What we don't know**: 
- Exact timing of capability transitions
- Whether new architectural breakthroughs might change propagation patterns
- How regulation might affect open model releases

---

## Conclusion

The Ratchet represents a quantifiable mechanism grounded in documented propagation patterns. Grove's exploration architecture positions perfectly to capture a trend that has persisted for six years and shows no deceleration.

The question isn't whether capabilities propagate from frontier to local—that pattern is established. The question is who builds infrastructure to capture this inevitable value transfer.

The Grove is that infrastructure.
