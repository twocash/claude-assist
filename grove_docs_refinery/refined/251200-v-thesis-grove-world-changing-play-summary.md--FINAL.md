# Grove: Exploration Architecture Summary

<aside>
🌳

**Grove addresses AI centralization risk by designing infrastructure where:**

- **Ownership is paramount:** Agents run on personal hardware with user-owned persistent memory, enabling sovereign distributed AI infrastructure *at the edge*.
- **Local processing is prioritized:** The "Cognitive Split" and "The Ratchet" ensure routine cognition becomes increasingly local and free.
- **Economics align with decentralization:** The "Efficiency Tax" incentivizes reduced cloud reliance.
- **Collective intelligence is distributed:** The "Knowledge Commons" enables shared learning without central control.

# Abstract

**Grove is exploration architecture for distributed AI infrastructure**—infrastructure for discovery that combines utility and emergent behavior to create a fundamentally different approach to human-AI collaboration.

These documents, authored by independent researcher Jim Calhoun, describe a system where **local AI models on consumer hardware are periodically enhanced by frontier models in the cloud**—a hybrid approach described through a pattern called "The Ratchet." The architecture recognizes that while **centralized AI currently dominates, the constant gap between frontier and local capability** means what requires cloud compute today will run locally tomorrow, supporting user-owned, sovereign computing. The system includes an economic model involving "Credits" and an "Efficiency Tax" that decreases as the network matures, and details a **governance structure designed for the eventual obsolescence of "The Grove Foundation,"** transferring power to the community.
