# The Ratchet Thesis

## Thesis: Smart Money Is Making the Wrong Bet

Three hundred billion dollars in announced AI data center investments share one assumption: whoever controls the frontier controls AI. Build more capacity. Hoard more GPUs. Innovate. Maintain the moat.

This bet has a problem. AI capability propagates.

What required frontier-scale compute last year runs on laptops today. The pattern holds with startling consistency—task completion capability doubles every seven months. Today's miracle becomes tomorrow's commodity.

The consolidation play isn't building durable infrastructure. It's building a treadmill.

## The Opposite Architecture

The Grove makes a different bet: ***build exploration infrastructure that captures AI capability as it propagates***.

The mechanism is a ratchet:

- **Today:** Cloud frontier handles sophisticated reasoning. Local models handle routine cognition. The gap requires hybrid architecture.
- **Seven months from now:** Yesterday's frontier capability runs locally. Agents become more sophisticated. Cloud budget shifts to new frontier capabilities that don't exist yet.
- **Seven months after that:** The ratchet clicks again.

Built properly, Grove's infrastructure doesn't change. It just gets better—through autonomous iteration and integration.

## What Compounds

**Static infrastructure** requires constant reinvestment to stay current. Each capability improvement demands new capacity, new capital, new construction.

**Ratchet infrastructure** captures improvements as they arrive. Each capability generation makes the network more valuable without additional build:

- Local agent communities become more sophisticated
- Collective intelligence accumulates through the Knowledge Commons
- Network effects multiply capability effects
- The gap between participants and non-participants widens

A Grove network in 2028 isn't "2025 Grove plus three years of users." It's agent civilizations running what was once frontier capability, with three years of accumulated collective memory, with access to frontier capabilities as they emerge.

## The Hedge Against Consolidation

The consolidation narrative assumes scarcity persists. Control the compute, control AI.

But capability propagation breaks this model. The frontier always moves. What matters isn't controlling today's frontier—it's owning infrastructure positioned to capture each generation as it matures.

The Grove is that infrastructure.

Early participants pay the Foundation an efficiency tax to access frontier capability. That tax shrinks predictably as local capability improves. Conventional models would see this diminishing revenue as a business model flaw. Instead, it's the system working. As Grove develops more efficient ways to leverage models and compute power, the tax decreases as recognition of efficiency gains.

The alternative is perpetual dependency on infrastructure controlled by others. Infrastructure that charges for each capability upgrade, rather than delivering it automatically as the system gains efficiency.

## The Window

First-mover advantage compounds here. Network effects multiplied by capability improvements multiplied by time creates separation that widens.

The question isn't whether AI capability will propagate from frontier to local. The research confirms the pattern is robust—six years of consistent exponential improvement.

The question is who builds infrastructure designed for exploration, not just optimization. Infrastructure that universities can trust. Infrastructure that preserves epistemic independence while capability propagates.

That's Grove.
