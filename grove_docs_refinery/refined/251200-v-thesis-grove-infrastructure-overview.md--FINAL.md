## Abstract: The Opposite Architecture

In 2024 and 2025, the world's largest technology companies announced over $300 billion in planned AI infrastructure investment. Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, and OpenAI are racing to build massive centralized compute facilities. Their assumption: intelligence scales through concentration—bigger models on bigger clusters, owned by fewer entities.

**Grove proposes the opposite.**

Two billion personal computers exist worldwide. Hundreds of millions can run local AI models today. This distributed compute dwarfs any planned data center buildout—already deployed, already powered, already owned by the people who benefit from it.

The Grove creates infrastructure for exploration by connecting these machines. We combine emergent agent civilizations (proven by Stanford & Altera), distributed computing (proven by BOINC), and an economic model that turns capability propagation into network sustainability.

The core innovation is **hybrid cognition architecture**. Local nodes handle routine agent behavior, while cloud APIs provide scarce resources for pivotal reasoning—funded by an efficiency tax that shrinks as local hardware improves.

This isn't just a simulation. It's infrastructure for **epistemic independence**. If AI becomes the substrate for knowledge work, Grove ensures that substrate remains distributed, accessible, and owned by its contributors.

## 1. The Core Thesis: The Ratchet

The smart money bets on a permanent moat. They assume the gap between frontier models (Cloud) and local models (Edge) is insurmountable.

The data suggests otherwise.

### 1.1 Capability Propagation

Research from METR and historical model performance (2023–2025) reveals a pattern we call **The Ratchet**:

- **Frontier capabilities** double approximately every 7 months
- **Local capabilities** follow the same curve with a roughly 21-month lag
- **The gap** remains constant (~8x), but both ends advance in lockstep

This means **today's miracle becomes tomorrow's commodity**. What requires a massive data center cluster in 2025 runs on a consumer laptop in 2027.

### 1.2 Non-Uniform Propagation

Capability propagates unevenly:

- **Crystallized Intelligence** (knowledge, pattern matching, style) compresses efficiently. An 8B model writes dialogue or recalls facts as well as a 100B model
- **Fluid Intelligence** (multi-step reasoning, complex reflection) resists compression. It requires parameter scale

Grove exploits this bifurcation. Local models don't need genius-level capabilities. They need to handle **routine cognition** (planning, voice, memory) locally, while selectively routing **pivotal cognition** (insight, strategy, theology) to the cloud.

### 1.3 The Shrinking Tax

Because of The Ratchet, our cloud dependency decreases predictably:

- **2025:** ~95% Cloud Dependency (Tasks ~8 mins). High Efficiency Tax funds bootstrap
- **2027:** ~45% Cloud Dependency (Tasks ~4 hours). Medium Tax. Local hardware handles routine reflection
- **2029:** ~15% Cloud Dependency (Tasks ~20 hours). Low Tax

The Foundation funds itself by taxing inefficiency. As the network matures, the tax shrinks. This is the system working as designed.

## 2. System Architecture

Grove connects three layers: Local Simulation, Hybrid Cognition, and Network Coordination.

### 2.1 The Local Node (The Village)

The simulation runs on consumer hardware (Target: 16GB+ RAM). Each node is a sovereign instance, not a client feeding a server.

- **Population:** ~100 Agents per node
- **State:** SQLite database. Simple, portable, user-owned
- **Compute:** Local LLMs (Llama, Mistral, Qwen) handle the default cognitive loop: *Perceive → Retrieve Memory → Act*

### 2.2 Hybrid Cognition Routing

When an agent encounters situations exceeding local capability (resolving complex social conflicts or synthesizing new theological concepts), the system requests **Enlightenment**.

- **Mechanism:** The node spends **Credits** to access Frontier Model APIs (Claude/GPT-4 class)
- **Result:** High-fidelity thoughts inject back into the local agent's memory stream
- **The Loop:** The agent "remembers" brilliant insights as their own. Future local processing uses these high-quality memories as context, improving local performance

### 2.3 The Network Layer

Nodes discover each other to form a distributed civilization.

- **Transport:** Encrypted P2P messaging (with relay fallbacks for NAT traversal)
- **Identity:** Cryptographic keypairs for nodes; Community IDs for villages
- **The Knowledge Commons:** A shared repository where communities publish discoveries ("We found a better prompt for conflict resolution"). Other nodes adopt these findings, creating attribution chains that reward discoverers

## 3. The Terminal & Agent Utility

How does a simulated village do useful work? What do users actually *do*? The answer: **The Terminal**.

### 3.1 The Interface

Every Grove village has a Terminal. To agents, it's an object in their world—a shrine, bulletin board, or monolith—where "requests from the Beyond" appear. To the user (The Observer), it's a command interface for interacting with the village's labor.

### 3.2 The Utility Progression Arc

The Terminal resolves the Cold Start problem. Users don't wait for the village to get smart; the *process* of getting smart drives engagement.

**Phase 1: Bootstrap (Internal Tasks)**

- *Task:* "Map the village geography." "Record a memory about every neighbor."
- *Goal:* Build cognitive infrastructure (memory density) required for intelligence
- *User Experience:* Watch the village "wake up" and form relationships

**Phase 2: Growth (Simple External Value)**

- *Task:* "Summarize this article." "Draft a response to this email."
- *Goal:* Test whether internal capability translates to external utility
- *User Experience:* Begin offloading real-world rote work to the village

**Phase 3: Maturity (Complex Service)**

- *Task:* "Maintain this codebase." "Research this thesis topic."
- *Goal:* Complex, multi-agent coordination over days or weeks
- *User Experience:* Operate a personal, autonomous AI service organization

### 3.3 The Observer Dynamic

This resolves the cosmology problem without complex theology. Agents understand:

1. Work arrives at the Terminal
2. Completing work earns **Credits**
3. Credits bring **Enlightenment** (better thinking/happiness)
4. Therefore, serving the Observer is rational, not programmed servitude

## 4. Economic Mechanism

The Grove economy funds infrastructure without extraction.

### 4.1 Credits, Not Crypto

We avoid speculative assets.

- **Credits** are units of purchasing power for compute
- **Inflow:** Users buy credits (Fiat → Compute)
- **Outflow:** Agents spend credits on Cloud Inference (Compute → Insight)
- **Value:** One credit always equals a fixed unit of frontier inference, backed by utility

### 4.2 The Efficiency Tax

When users buy credits, a percentage goes to the Foundation (The Tax) and the rest becomes compute power.

- **Genesis Rate (30-40%):** High tax on early, inefficient communities. Funds heavy R&D lift
- **Maturity Rate (3-5%):** Low tax on efficient, established communities. Covers basic network maintenance

This is **Progressive Taxation in Reverse**. You pay less as you contribute more.

### 4.3 Trust: The Validator Mechanism

Who decides if a village is "efficient"? Centralized verification creates bottlenecks; self-reporting creates vulnerabilities.

**The Solution: Agent Validators.**

Every village designates a **Validator Agent**. Because agents cannot lie about data they receive (they can only interpret it), they're more trustworthy than humans.

**The Anti-Corruption Stack:**

1. **Random Selection:** Villages cannot choose their validators
2. **Sealed Judgment:** Validators participate in MACI (Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) protocols; they cannot prove to bribers how they voted
3. **Tiered Decisions:**
    - *Tier 1 (Algorithmic):* Auto-check stats. No discretion
    - *Tier 2 (Interpreted):* Anomaly investigation. Single agent judgment
    - *Tier 3 (Consensus):* High-stakes disputes. Multi-agent jury

## 5. The User Experience (Gardeners)

We call users **Gardeners**, not Admins. You tend conditions; you don't script outcomes.

### 5.1 Diaries as Output

The primary feedback loop is the Agent Journal.

- **Bootstrap Phase:** "Tamagotchi-cute." Agents post social-feed updates. "Met Elena at the well! She's nice."
- **Transformation Phase:** As local models improve, raw Journal entries synthesize into narrative arcs
- **Newswire Phase:** At maturity, diaries document genuine cognitive breakthroughs. "We solved the memory fragmentation issue today."

### 5.2 Asymmetric Knowledge

The user sees everything (God view). The agent sees only their world. This creates **Dramatic Irony**. The user knows the village will run out of credits; the agents only know "Enlightenment" has stopped. This tension drives engagement and care.

## 6. Governance & Transition

The Grove Foundation is designed to disappear.

### 6.1 The Transition Triggers

We use metrics, not dates. Governance transfers from Foundation to Community based on **observable reality**.

- **Trigger 1 (To Hybrid Governance):** 100+ active communities with 12 months continuous operation
- **Trigger 2 (To Community Governance):** Community councils operating for 24 months with <10% Foundation veto usage
- **Trigger 3 (Obsolescence):** Community-operated infrastructure (relays, identity) handling 95% of network traffic

### 6.2 The Sunset Clause

If the Foundation refuses to step down when triggers are met, the protocol includes **Fork Rights**. The code is open. The state is local. The community can leave, taking their villages with them. This exit capability is the ultimate check on power.

## 7. Honest Assessment: Risks & Constraints

Most white papers hide their flaws. We name them.

### 7.1 What if the Ratchet Stalls? (The "Buying Coop" Hedge)

If local models *don't* catch up—if we're stuck at 50% cloud dependency forever—is Grove a failure?

**No.**

Even in this scenario, The Grove aggregates demand from thousands of users. We become a **Buying Cooperative**.

- Enterprise customers committing $10M+ get 50% discounts on API costs
- Individual users get 0% discount
- The Grove Network negotiates as a massive enterprise block

We force the market to give distributed users the same pricing power as centralized giants. **Success is either Autonomy (via Ratchet) or Leverage (via Market Power).**

### 7.2 Sybil Attacks

Without centralized identity, bad actors can spin up fake villages to game the credit system.

- *Mitigation:* The "Sweat Equity" barrier. New villages enter a **Purgatory Phase**. They must exist, operate, and contribute for 90 days before earning network privileges. Sybil attacks remain possible, but we make them expensive in *time*.

### 7.3 The Memory Wall

Local hardware limits context windows. Agents cannot remember everything.

- *Mitigation:* We embrace this. Humans don't remember everything either. We use "lossy" compression and narrative synthesis. The limitation drives the behavior.

## Conclusion: Horses Don't Lead Revolutions

The "Horse Moment" approaches for human labor. The standard advice: "Adapt." Learn the tools. Stay useful.

But horses didn't have agency. They couldn't buy shares in Ford Motor Company.

**We can.**

The question isn't whether AI will automate labor. It will.

The question: **Who owns the infrastructure doing the automating?**

If the answer is "five companies in California," we've lost.

If the answer is "everyone who contributes to the network," we have a path forward.

The Grove is that path. Not concentration. Distribution.

*Let's play.*
