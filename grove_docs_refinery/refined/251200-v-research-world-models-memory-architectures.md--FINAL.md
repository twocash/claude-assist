# World Models and Memory Architectures for Grove's Exploration Infrastructure

**Hybrid neuro-symbolic world models, hierarchical memory systems, and edge-optimized inference represent the three architectural pillars for building persistent, locally-intelligent AI entities.** This technical brief synthesizes research on world modeling, memory architectures, and knowledge propagation to inform Grove's exploration architecture—an infrastructure emphasizing local cognition, hybrid processing, and persistent intelligence. The key insight: **no single approach dominates**. Optimal exploration architectures combine compact latent models for real-time control, transformer models for long-context reasoning, hierarchical memory for persistence, and principled cloud-to-edge knowledge transfer.
