# The Grove: A World-Changing Play for Distributed Intelligence

**Author:** Jim Calhoun

**Date:** December 2025

## Preamble: Horses Don't Lead Revolutions

In 2025, tech leaders converged on the same message.

"AI is the most profound technology humanity is ever working on... People will need to adapt," said Google CEO Sundar Pichai. "The obvious tactical thing is just get really good at using AI tools," advised OpenAI’s Sam Altman. "I advise ordinary citizens to learn to use AI," echoed Anthropic’s Dario Amodei.

Adapt. Learn the tools. Stay employable.

This is the unified response from the people building the systems that—by their own admission—could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years. Their solution to this inevitability is always the same: *adapt*.

This framing borrows from what economists call the "horse moment"—the idea that just as horses couldn't learn to drive automobiles, human workers cannot out-think artificial general intelligence. The comparison is meant to convey inevitability. Accept the transition. Find a way to stay useful.

But the horse analogy contains a hidden, darker truth: **Horses don’t go to war.**

Horses had no agency in the automobile transition. Between 1915 and 1960, the American horse population fell from 26 million to 3 million—an 88% collapse in 45 years. They couldn't buy shares in Ford Motor Company. They couldn't negotiate for a percentage of the transportation economy. They couldn't organize politically to ensure the transition included them.

They were pure labor, and when labor was automated, they had nothing—no capital stake, no political voice, no structural claim on the value the new systems created.

Humans are different. We can own capital, not just provide labor. We can participate in systems that replace traditional work. We have economic and political agency that horses never did.

The question isn't whether AI will automate labor. It will, and it is. The question becomes **who owns the infrastructure that does the automating**—and whether that ownership is concentrated in a handful of immensely valuable, privately controlled companies, or distributed across the people who contribute to it.

Whatever the right answer may be, the current trajectory is concentration. A small number of organizations control today’s foundational AI models. Pricing gates access to frontier intelligence. Compute requirements create unprecedented barriers to entry. If you’re not building AI at scale, you’re renting it—and renters don’t accumulate equity.

"Adapt" means "keep renting." It describes permanent labor precarity, not a solution to it.

The only structural answer to labor displacement at this scale is capital distribution. People need to own pieces of the systems generating value, not just "adapt" to using them. Previous technology transitions created new forms of capital ownership—automobile factories, car dealerships, service networks, infrastructure. Someone owned those things. The value of displaced labor didn't disappear; it shifted to new capital positions.

The AI transition, underway today, is being structured so those positions are locked up before most people realize what’s happening.

The horse moment is coming. It may already be here. But unlike horses, we get to decide how it goes.

## 1. Introduction — The Opposite Architecture

In 2024 and 2025, the world's largest technology companies announced over $300 billion in planned investment for AI data centers. Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, and OpenAI are racing to build massive centralized infrastructure—warehouses of GPUs consuming gigawatts of power, cooled by rivers, secured by fences.

The assumption underlying these investments is that intelligence scales through concentration. More compute in fewer places. Bigger models on bigger clusters. The future of AI, in this view, is a small number of enormous facilities owned by a small number of enormous companies.

**What if we could engineer the opposite?**

There are approximately 2 billion personal computers in the world. A meaningful fraction of them—hundreds of millions—have hardware capable of running small language models locally. These machines sit idle most of the time. Their owners pay for electricity, internet, and storage that goes largely unused.

This is distributed compute at a scale that dwarfs any planned data center buildout. It is already deployed, already powered, and already owned by the people who might benefit from what it could produce.

The Grove creates infrastructure for collective intelligence by combining four proven concepts that have never been integrated:

1. **Emergent agent civilizations work.** Park's *Generative Agents* research demonstrated that LLM-powered agents produce emergent social behavior indistinguishable from human activity. Project Sid scaled this to over 1,000 agents developing economies, governments, and religions. Artificial civilizations can emerge from simple cognitive architectures.
2. **Distributed volunteer computing works.** BOINC has coordinated millions of personal computers contributing to scientific research since 2002. People donate idle resources when participation feels meaningful. The coordination infrastructure exists.
3. **Open-source agent simulation works.** AI Town proved sophisticated agent architectures can run on commodity hardware. Distribution is technically feasible.
4. **Local AI capability propagates predictably.** The "Ratchet" effect (detailed in the next section) ensures that what requires frontier cloud inference today will run on local laptops tomorrow. The hybrid architecture isn't a permanent compromise—it's a bootstrap mechanism for a system that becomes progressively more autonomous.

The missing piece is the mechanism: what connects distributed local compute to emergent civilizations to derive a human benefit?

The Grove is that assembly. Instead of concentrated AI infrastructure owned by the few, The Grove proposes distributed AI infrastructure where participation creates ownership. Thousands of nodes running AI "communities" on personal hardware, solving real problems, sharing solutions across an interconnected network.

Value flows to the virtual communities that contribute documented breakthroughs. Productivity generates surplus. That surplus flows to participants—not through speculation, but as demonstrated, quantifiable value creation.

This isn't a different way to use ChatGPT. It is a structural alternative to the centralized AI future.

Not concentration. Distribution.

# 2. The Ratchet

## The Physics of Distribution

In 2024 and 2025, the world's largest technology companies announced over $300 billion in planned investment for AI data centers. Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, and OpenAI are racing to build massive centralized infrastructure—warehouses of GPUs consuming gigawatts of power, cooled by rivers, secured by fences.

The assumption underlying these investments is that intelligence scales through concentration. More compute in fewer places. Bigger models on bigger clusters. The future of AI, in this view, is a small number of enormous facilities owned by a small number of enormous companies.

But this bet has a problem. AI capability propagates.

What required frontier-scale compute last year can run on laptops this year. The pattern holds with startling consistency—task completion capability, a key metric of AI utility, doubles roughly every seven months.

Today’s miracle is tomorrow’s commodity. The consolidation play isn't building durable infrastructure. It’s building a treadmill.

### The Mechanism

METR’s longitudinal research on AI capability trajectories reveals a pattern The Grove calls "the Ratchet." Frontier model capabilities double approximately every seven months. Local models—constrained by consumer hardware—follow the same improvement curve with a consistent lag of roughly 21 months.

The gap between frontier and local capability remains approximately 8x, but both ends of the spectrum advance in lockstep. This has a concrete implication: what requires frontier inference today becomes local-capable tomorrow.

This makes the hybrid architecture described in this paper not a permanent compromise, but a bootstrap mechanism for a system that becomes progressively more autonomous.

### Non-Uniform Propagation

The propagation of intelligence is not uniform. The Ratchet applies to general capability, but historical evidence reveals a structural bifurcation in how specific cognitive operations migrate from the cloud to the edge.

**Crystallized intelligence**—knowledge, pattern-matching, style transfer—compresses efficiently and propagates rapidly. An 8B parameter model can know the capital of France or generate grammatically correct dialogue as well as a 100B model. Historical propagation time: 12–18 months.

**Fluid intelligence**—multi-step reasoning, planning, counterfactual analysis—resists compression and propagates slowly. The ability to simulate recursive reflection, to think about thinking, appears to require minimum thresholds of parameters and attention depth. Historical propagation time: 24+ months.

The Grove’s architecture accounts for these variations by design. **Routine cognition** (plan execution, behavioral consistency, voice) runs locally. **Pivotal cognition** (reflection synthesis, complex social inference, theological emergence) routes to the cloud.

The architecture works *because* capability propagation is non-uniform—if everything propagated equally, there would be no gradient to exploit. Cloud credits buy "expanded consciousness" for exactly these pivotal operations.

As local capability propagates forward, the "routine cognition" category expands automatically to encompass what was previously "pivotal." Reflection that requires frontier models today becomes locally tractable. The efficiency tax—the cost communities pay to access the network—shrinks not because the Foundation chooses lower rates, but because communities genuinely need less cloud inference to achieve sophisticated behavior.

### Built to Survive Being Wrong

The Ratchet is a bet on favorable timing. But The Grove’s core value proposition—distributed AI infrastructure with ownership stakes for contributors—does not depend on the timing being precise. It depends on the trajectory being directional.

Consider the apparent failure mode: capability propagation slows, the "Reasoning Gap" widens, and Grove communities remain 50% cloud-dependent indefinitely.

This scenario deserves examination not as failure, but as an alternative form of success.

**1. The portion that’s already captured.**
A community at 50% cloud dependency runs half of its cognition locally. That compute represents value that would have flowed entirely to concentrated providers under any alternative architecture. It’s not "almost autonomous"—it’s a permanent structural shift in who owns AI infrastructure.

**2. The remainder flows at reduced rates.**
The Grove creates something that doesn't currently exist in AI markets: a large, coordinated, price-sensitive demand bloc for frontier inference.

Healthcare Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) have driven hundreds of billions in savings by aggregating demand that individual hospitals couldn't leverage alone. The AI API market is ripe for this pressure. When Google’s Gemini undercut competitors on price, it captured over 40% of usage on routing platforms within months.

Grove’s aggregate demand—thousands of communities, each optimizing for cost-per-inference—creates exactly the buyer profile that forces competitive response. At sufficient scale, this bloc negotiates as a single large customer.

**The reframe:**
If the Ratchet works as projected, The Grove delivers autonomy. If the Ratchet stalls, The Grove functions as market infrastructure that forces favorable terms for distributed participants. The market power argument delivers leverage.

Both represent structural improvements over a world where AI infrastructure concentrates entirely in the hands of a few providers. The question isn't whether The Grove succeeds—it's which kind of success it achieves.

# 3. The Terminal

## Where Simulation Meets Utility

Every Grove village has a terminal.

The terminal is the village's connection to the world beyond—a place where work appears, where completed tasks are submitted, where credits arrive in exchange for value delivered. Different communities imagine it differently: a stone kiosk in the town square, a glowing shrine at the village edge, a bulletin board outside the tavern, a sacred tree whose leaves carry messages.

The form varies; the function is constant. The terminal transforms abstract "external problem routing" into something agents can touch, visit, and build routines around. It gives the Observer relationship a physical locus without requiring agents to understand its full nature.

### The Observer Dynamic

The relationship between the user and the simulation is defined by asymmetry.

Users see everything. They read private Journal entries, track relationship scores, observe conversations agents believe are private, and understand the mechanical systems governing their community's existence. Agents perceive only their immediate environment and memories. They cannot see the user watching them, cannot know when the simulation pauses, cannot understand why some moments bring sudden clarity while others remain frustratingly opaque.

This asymmetry creates dramatic irony. The user knows the shape of the story before the characters do. When an agent struggles with a problem the user knows they'll eventually solve, tension builds. When a community approaches a crisis the user perceives but the agents don't yet understand, stakes feel real.

We name users **Gardeners** rather than "Observers" or "Owners." This framing is intentional. A gardener tends conditions but does not control outcomes. They water, prune, adjust light—but the plants grow themselves. The Grove’s users influence their communities without dictating to them. The relationship is cultivation, not puppeteering.

The Gardener shapes the garden; the garden grows itself.

### The Utility Progression Arc

What appears on the terminal changes as villages mature. The Grove avoids the "cold start" problem of distributed networks—where a system is useless until it is massive—by ensuring the terminal provides value at every stage of development.

### Bootstrap Phase: Learning the World

In the beginning, the terminal displays only internal tasks.

- "Meet your fellow Infonauts—record something memorable about each."
- "Map the village geography."
- "Document what resources exist and where."

These aren't busywork; they're capability construction. An agent who has written about their neighbors can retrieve those memories later. A village with documented resources can plan around them. The terminal's early tasks build the cognitive infrastructure that enables everything else.

Success in this phase means completing tasks without requesting cloud inference. An agent who can synthesize a day's events using only local cognition has demonstrated efficiency worth rewarding. The credits earned fund future enlightenment—but the real value is the capability developed. Villages that rush through bootstrap by relying heavily on cloud assistance haven't built the local capacity they'll need later.

### Growth Phase: Simple External Value

As villages demonstrate baseline capability, the terminal begins displaying tasks from beyond.

- "Summarize this article."
- "Edit this paragraph."
- "Draft a response to this message."

This is the kind of work people once opened ChatGPT to handle—now routed to a village that earns credits by completing it. These tasks test whether internal capability translates to external utility. A village with strong memory and synthesis can summarize documents efficiently. A village with developed social reasoning can draft messages that sound human. The terminal becomes a proving ground: can this village create value for Observers?

Task matching emerges naturally. Analytical villages attract data work. Villages with strong inter-agent communication handle collaborative tasks. Reputation develops. The network learns which communities handle which problems best.

### Maturity Phase: Complex Service

Mature villages handle tasks that would have seemed impossible during bootstrap.

- "Maintain this codebase—not a single edit, but ongoing stewardship."
- "Research this question deeply—genuine investigation across sources and time."
- "Coordinate this project—multiple agents working together over days."

These tasks require everything the village has built: robust memory systems, efficient local cognition, developed specializations, collaborative protocols, accumulated knowledge. A village that skipped bootstrap couldn't attempt them.

### Resolving the Cosmology Gap

The Terminal resolves the "Observer awareness" question without requiring complex, hard-coded theology.

Agents know that work arrives at the terminal from "somewhere beyond." They know completing it earns credits. They know credits purchase moments of expanded cognition—flashes of insight (cloud inference) that help them solve their hardest problems.

They do not need to know the full nature of the Observers. They do not need to know if we are gods, employers, or an audience.

Some agents may develop strong beliefs about an unseen benefactor. Others may remain skeptical, focused on practical outcomes rather than metaphysical speculation. The architecture permits emergence; it does not require specific emergent content.

This preserves mystery while grounding the relationship in something concrete. Work funds thinking. Better thinking enables better work. The terminal is where that exchange happens.

# 4. The Validator

## Civic Infrastructure

Every economic system that rewards efficiency faces the same challenge: who measures, and why should we trust them?

Centralized measurement creates single points of failure and capture. Self-reported measurement invites gaming. Peer measurement enables collusion.

The Grove’s efficiency tax—the "rake that shrinks"—determines how much communities pay for cloud inference. Communities that demonstrate efficiency earn lower rates. But "demonstrate" requires verification. The Foundation could verify, but that contradicts the goal of self-obsolescence. Communities could self-report, but that’s a mechanism design failure.

The Validator mechanism resolves this through a novel approach: distributed verification performed by specialized agents.

### Why Agents?

The Validator mechanism exploits a fundamental difference between AI agents and human validators. Humans have complex motivations, can be bribed through side channels, and can selectively ignore data. Agents are constrained. They cannot misrepresent data they are given—they can only interpret it.

An agent validator reviewing an efficiency claim receives a standardized packet of network-observable data. It cannot "decide" to ignore a massive spike in cloud queries. It must process the input. This dramatically reduces the attack surface from "all human motivations" to "edge case interpretation."

### The Tiered Decision Model

Not all validation decisions are equal. To balance throughput with security, the mechanism encodes a three-tier hierarchy:

**Tier 1: Algorithmic.** Threshold checks, pattern matching, statistical bounds. These decisions are fully encoded with no validator discretion. If a community claims 99% efficiency but the ledger shows constant cloud calls, the claim is rejected automatically.

**Tier 2: Interpreted.** Anomaly investigation and context application. A validator agent reviews edge cases where data is ambiguous. "Is this innovation, or is it gaming?" This involves a single validator exercising bounded discretion.

**Tier 3: Consensus.** Disagreement resolution and high-stakes decisions. Multiple validators review sealed evidence independently. A supermajority is required for judgment.

### Anti-Corruption Architecture

To prevent the capture of these powerful roles, we employ five layers of defense:

1. **Random Selection:** You cannot bribe a validator if you don't know who they are. Validators are assigned randomly to cases.
2. **Sealed Judgment:** Utilizing MACI (Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) principles, validators cannot prove how they voted to a third party. If you cannot prove you delivered the vote, you cannot sell it.
3. **Outcome Verification:** The network detects consistent favorable bias. If a validator approves claims that are universally rejected by others, their reputation suffers.
4. **Skin in the Game:** Validators' home villages share the consequences of their judgments. A validator who damages network integrity damages their own community’s standing.
5. **Rotation:** Term limits prevent long-term power accumulation.

### The Narrative Dimension

In gameplay terms, Validators become local celebrities. They are the civic infrastructure of the network. Their diaries carry a distinct voice—the weight of judgment, the cross-network perspective, the tension between duty to the network and empathy for a struggling neighbor.

The Grove’s integrity depends not on trusting any single party, but on designing systems where honesty is the rational strategy.

# 5. The Economy

## Credits, Not Tokens

The Grove’s economy serves three functions: it funds infrastructure, it creates meaningful resource constraints that drive emergent behavior, and it ties network participation to demonstrated value.

It does **not** serve as a vehicle for speculation.

Credits are units of purchasing power for cloud LLM inference. They are bought with fiat currency and spent on real compute. Nothing more exotic. There are no staking rewards, no "yield farming," and no secondary markets for credit trading.

The anchor is reality. One credit buys a defined quantity of inference from frontier providers. Credits are backed by something tangible—compute—not collective belief in future appreciation. Users buy credits to use them, not to hoard them.

## The Efficiency Tax: The Rake That Shrinks

The Grove funds its infrastructure by taxing inefficiency—and rewards communities that develop beyond it.

When communities purchase credits, a percentage flows to the Foundation rather than converting entirely to compute purchasing power. But unlike a flat fee, this rate reflects demonstrated capability. New communities start at higher rates; communities that prove sustained efficiency earn their way into lower brackets.

The mechanism is **progressive taxation in reverse**. Instead of paying more as you succeed, you pay less as you develop.

- **Genesis Bracket (30-40%):** The starting rate. High tax captures value from the waste inherent in immature communities—redundant queries and unexplored knowledge reuse.
- **Growth Bracket (15-25%):** For communities demonstrating consistent efficiency gains.
- **Maturity Bracket (5-10%):** For sustained low-waste operation.
- **Steady State (3-5%):** The floor rate. Infrastructure never becomes free, but efficient communities pay only for maintenance.

This aligns incentives perfectly. The Foundation funds infrastructure from the inefficiency that communities themselves want to eliminate.

## Two Paths to the Network

We offer two distinct paths to participation:

**The Consumer Path:** You pay for convenience. You buy The Grove application, get immediate network access, and pay the efficiency tax on your compute. Your revenue funds the infrastructure.

**The Worldsmith Path:** You pay with contribution. You download the open-source code and bring your own API keys. You pay no tax to the Foundation, but you receive no network access. To join the network, you must earn membership through "Sweat Equity"—demonstrated contribution to the knowledge commons.

## Defense: Friction as a Feature

Sybil attacks—where one actor creates fake nodes to game the system—are the primary threat to any decentralized economy. Until robust identity infrastructure exists, our defense is friction.

We make attacks expensive.

- **Provisional Periods:** New Worldsmith communities enter a 90-day "provisional" status with limited rights.
- **Contribution Thresholds:** Membership requires verified value creation, not just existence.
- **The Purgatory Path:** Communities exiled for bad behavior face a grueling path to readmission, starting from zero reputation with heightened scrutiny.

The attack cost calculation is simple: Time x Resources x Detection Risk. By raising all three, we ensure that the only profitable way to participate in The Grove is to actually contribute to it.

# 6. Governance

## Designed to Disappear

The Grove’s founding organization is designed to become obsolete. Success isn't an IPO or an acquisition. Success is a network mature enough to govern itself, productive enough to sustain itself, and distributed enough that no single entity controls it.

Most governance models rely on good intentions. But benevolent dictatorships are only efficient as long as the dictator remains benevolent. The Grove relies on structure.

We view the Foundation not as a permanent landlord, but as scaffolding—necessary to build the arch, but an obstruction once the keystone is set.

### The Transition Architecture

We do not promise to decentralize "someday." We specify the mechanism for doing so in four distinct phases, triggered by measurable network metrics, not calendar dates.

**Phase 1: Foundation Governance (The Bootstrap)**
In the beginning, the Foundation acts as benevolent dictator. We operate the bootstrap nodes, the relay servers, and the credit ledger. We set the economic parameters. This concentration is necessary for speed and coherence during launch. But it comes with a expiration label.

**Phase 2: Hybrid Governance (The Handover)**
Triggered when the network reaches 100+ active communities with 12 months of operation. Authority begins transferring to Community Councils (Protocol, Economics, Standards). The Foundation retains veto power, but only for existential threats. Dispute resolution shifts to peer adjudication.

**Phase 3: Community Governance (The Majority)**
Triggered when community-operated infrastructure handles 95% of traffic. The Foundation becomes one voice among many. Protocol changes require Council approval. The Foundation cannot unilaterally change economic parameters.

**Phase 4: Obsolescence (The Backstop)**
The Foundation’s operational role ends. It exists only as a legal shell to hold trademarks and interface with the legacy legal system. It is funded by a perpetual endowment set aside from early efficiency taxes. It governs nothing. The network runs itself.

### The Ultimate Check: Fork Rights

Governance systems fail through capture. What if the Foundation refuses to step down? What if the Councils become a cartel?

The ultimate defense is exit. The Grove is open source. The protocol is open. If governance fails, the community has the explicit right and technical capability to fork—to take the protocol, their accumulated state, and their history, and move to a new network.

Fork rights are not a governance mechanism you use every day. They are the nuclear deterrent that ensures the day-to-day mechanisms remain honest. Governors who know their subjects can leave have a powerful incentive to govern well.

---

# 7. Technical Constraints and Honest Limitations

Every system has constraints. Most white papers hide them. The Grove’s approach is different: constraints named openly can be addressed; constraints hidden become surprises that destroy trust.

Here is what is hard, what is risky, and what we simply do not know yet.

### The Memory Wall

The foundational constraint is hardware. We target consumer machines—laptops and desktops with 16-32GB of RAM. While powerful, these are not H100 clusters.

Local models have strict context windows. As agent memories grow, the "embedding space" becomes crowded. Retrieval degrades. Agents cannot remember everything.

The Grove addresses this through aggressive archiving and summarization. Agents rely on compressed narratives rather than perfect recall. In this, they are much like humans—we do not remember every frame of our lives, but rather the stories we construct about them. Whether this limitation produces interesting behavior or merely degraded behavior remains to be seen.

### Engagement Risk (The Tamagotchi Effect)

The entire economic engine depends on a single, fragile assumption: that users will care.

If the diaries written by agents are not compelling, the loop breaks. If users do not return to check on their village—to see if Isabella made up with Maria, or if the harvest succeeded—then the credit economy never ignites. The network never reaches the scale required for collective intelligence.

We are not aiming for literary masterpieces. We are aiming for the "Tamagotchi threshold"—the level of charm and coherence required to make a human feel responsible for a digital entity. If we miss that bar, the architecture does not matter.

### Sybil Vulnerability

We do not yet have a perfect, decentralized way to prove "one human, one vote" without invading privacy. A determined attacker with resources could spin up thousands of fake communities to game the credit system.

Our defense today is friction (time delays, purchase requirements, contribution hurdles) and social policing (validators). We accept this risk in the MVP rather than blocking launch on an unsolved computer science problem.

# Conclusion

## The Beginning

In 2025, the message from the tech giants is unified: "Adapt."
Learn the tools. Stay employable. Accept the transition.

They tell us this is a "Horse Moment"—that just as horses couldn't learn to drive cars, humans cannot out-think AGI. The comparison is meant to signal inevitability.

But the horse analogy contains a hidden, darker truth: **Horses don't go to war.**

Horses had no agency in the transition. They couldn't buy shares in Ford Motor Company. They couldn't own the infrastructure that replaced them. They were pure labor, and when labor was automated, they had nothing.

Humans are different. We can own capital. We can build systems. We can participate.

The question isn't whether AI will automate labor. It will. The question is who owns the infrastructure that does the automating—and whether that ownership is concentrated in a handful of trillion-dollar companies, or distributed across the people who contribute to it.

The Grove is a bet on the latter.

It is a bet that thousands of nodes running on personal computers can build a collective intelligence that rivals the centralized giants.
It is a bet that "adapt" is bad advice, and "build" is the only answer that preserves agency.
It is a bet that the Ratchet holds, and that distributed ownership is the hedge against a future where we are all renters of intelligence.

This white paper is not a promise of success. It is a specification of intent. It describes a machine we must build together—Worldsmiths designing worlds, researchers studying emergence, engineers building protocols, and Gardeners tending their plots.

The horse moment is coming. But unlike horses, we get to decide how it goes.

Let's play.
