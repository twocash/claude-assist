# The Grove: A World Changing Play for Distributed Intelligence

<aside>
🌳

**The Grove addresses the inherent risk in AI centralization by designing an architecture where:**

- **Ownership is paramount:** Agents run on personal hardware and their persistent memory is user-owned, putting sovereign distributed intelligence and knowledge *at the edge*.
- **Local processing is prioritized:** The "Cognitive Split" and "The Ratchet" ensure that routine cognition becomes increasingly local and free.
- **Economics align with decentralization:** The "Efficiency Tax" incentivizes reduced cloud reliance.
- **Collective intelligence is distributed:** The "Knowledge Commons" allows for shared learning without central control.

# Abstract

**"The Grove" envisions an architecture for distributed artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure** aimed at a post-labor economy — combining entertainment and utility in novel ways to produce a vastly different vision of our AI futre. 

These documents, authored by independent researcher Jim Calhoun, proposes a system where **local AI models on consumer hardware are periodically enhanced by frontier models in the cloud**—a hybrid approach described through a pattern called "The Ratchet." The text emphasizes that while **centralized AI currently dominates, a constant gap between frontier and local capability** means what is high-end today will be accessible locally tomorrow, supporting the vision of user-owned, sovereign computing. This system includes an economic model involving "Credits" and an "Efficiency Tax" that decreases as the network matures, and it details a **governance structure designed for the eventual obsolescence of "The Grove Foundation,"** transferring power to the community.

*The Grove exists as a specification; whether it exists as infrastructure depends on what we build together. We think it’s a game worth playing.*
