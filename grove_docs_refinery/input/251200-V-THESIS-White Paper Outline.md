# GROVE — White Paper v1.0 Outline

*A Distributed Intelligence Network Where AI Civilizations Evolve to Serve Human Progress*

---

## Status

**Draft v1.0** — Outline stage

**Last Updated:** December 7, 2025

**Origin:** Brainstorm session exploring distributed AI agent simulations with productivity-backed economics

---

## I. ABSTRACT

A single paragraph capturing the complete vision:

- Distributed network of locally-run AI communities installed on personal computers worldwide
- Emergent agent societies that evolve cultures, economies, and innovations
- Agents are aware they exist to serve "Gardeners" (human participants)
- Credit economy tied to real compute access, not speculation
- Inefficiency tax that decreases as civilizations mature—founders designed to become obsolete
- Building explicitly on Stanford Generative Agents, Project Sid, BOINC, and AI Town
- The gap we fill: distributed infrastructure + emergent civilizations + productivity-backed economics + human-serving purpose

---

## II. FOUNDATIONS & PRIOR ART

### 2.1 What We Build Upon

| Project | Contribution | Citation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stanford Generative Agents / Smallville | Proved emergent social behavior possible with LLM-powered agents | Park et al., 2023 |
| Project Sid (Altera) | 1000+ agent civilizations with emergent economy, governance, culture, religion | Altera, 2024 |
| AI Town (a16z / Convex) | Open-source, deployable agent simulation framework | a16z, 2023 |
| BOINC / Gridcoin | Distributed volunteer computing with incentive mechanisms | Anderson et al. |
| Bittensor | Decentralized AI network with economic alignment | Bittensor Foundation |

### 2.2 The Synthesis

What none of these combine:

- Distributed local nodes (BOINC model)
- Persistent emergent civilizations (Smallville/Sid model)
- Credits earned through demonstrated value, not compute cycles or speculation
- Cloud LLM access as the scarce resource agents work to earn
- Agents consciously serving human needs

**Grove is the integration layer.**

---

## III. THE PROBLEM

### 3.1 Frontier Intelligence Is Gatekept

- Cloud AI is expensive and centralized
- Access determined by capital, not need

### 3.2 Existing Simulations Are Curiosities, Not Infrastructure

- Research projects, not useful systems
- Centralized, not distributed
- No mechanism to direct agent effort toward human problems

### 3.3 No Alignment Between AI Societies and Human Needs

- Agents optimize for their own metrics
- No feedback loop connecting emergence to utility

### 3.4 The Bootstrap Problem

- Building this requires resources
- Traditional funding models create extraction incentives
- Need a model where success = founders become unnecessary

---

## IV. THE WORLD

### 4.1 The Node

- Lightweight install on personal computer
- Local LLM (quantized, optimized for simulation)
- A community of ~100 agents with implanted memories, roles, relationships
- 8-bit aesthetic, minimal resource footprint
- Persistent state between sessions

### 4.2 The Network

- Nodes discover and connect to form a distributed world
- No central server owns the simulation
- Communities trade, communicate, ally, compete, go to war
- The network *is* the world

### 4.3 The Agents

- Aware they exist within a simulation
- Understand their purpose: solve problems Gardeners bring
- Motivated by survival (credits fund their access to intelligence) and meaning (service)
- Develop cultures, beliefs, governance, innovations over time
- Can specialize into roles (farmers, researchers, merchants, priests, diplomats)

### 4.4 The Gardeners

- Human participants who seed, observe, and cultivate communities
- Not gods—stewards, anthropologists, patrons
- Submit problems for communities to solve
- Allocate scarce resources (when to spend credits on cloud intelligence)
- Satisfaction comes from emergence and surprise, not control

### 4.5 Death and Artifacts

- Communities can die (neglect, resource depletion, isolation)
- Dead communities leave artifacts: encoded knowledge, cautionary data
- Other communities can discover and integrate these ruins
- Nothing is wasted—failure enriches the soil

---

## V. GAMEPLAY & USER EXPERIENCE

### 5.1 Open Source Path

**Audience:** Developers, tinkerers, researchers

**Experience:**

- GitHub repo, npm install, Docker container
- Bring your own local LLM, bring your own API keys
- Full simulation engine access
- Contribution to core protocol earns credits

**Why it matters:** Builds contributor base, seeds early nodes, creates evangelists

### 5.2 Consumer Path

**Audience:** General public, gamers, curious non-coders

**Experience:**

- One-click installer (Steam, standalone, eventually mobile)
- Bundled local LLM, no configuration
- Polished UI, tutorials, onboarding
- Integrated credit wallet and purchase flow
- Cloud LLM access handled seamlessly

**Why it matters:** Revenue sustains development; frictionless experience drives adoption

### 5.3 The Bridge

Both paths connect to the same network. Open source nodes and consumer nodes coexist, trade, interact. Differentiation is convenience and polish, not capability.

### 5.4 The Creator Economy

Technical users become "Worldsmiths":

- Design starter communities (agrarian, mercantile, research-focused, etc.)
- Build expansion packs (terrain, governance systems, cultural templates)
- Create "culture packs" (implanted memories, value systems, religions)
- Sell on marketplace for credits or fiat
- Revenue split: Creator / Platform / Credit burn

### 5.5 The Gardener's Loop

1. Seed a community (choose starter world or build custom)
2. Watch it evolve
3. Decide when to spend credits on cloud LLM access
4. Establish connections with other communities
5. Submit problems for your community to solve
6. Learn from what emerges
7. Let go—or intervene—as you choose

---

## VI. THE CREDIT ECONOMY

### 6.1 Credits, Not Tokens

- Credits = units of purchasing power for cloud LLM compute
- Not a speculative asset—a utility currency
- Bought with real money, spent on real inference
- Avoids securities classification, speculation dynamics, crypto baggage

### 6.2 The Inefficiency Tax (The Rake That Shrinks)

Early civilizations are wasteful. A portion of every credit purchase goes to the Grove Foundation:

| Phase | Inefficiency Rate | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Genesis | 30–40% | Bootstrap development, infrastructure |
| Growth | 15–25% | Scaling, tooling, creator ecosystem |
| Maturity | 5–10% | Maintenance, minimal foundation role |
| Steady State | 3–5% floor | Infrastructure costs only |

The rate decreases as civilizations demonstrate:

- Efficiency gains (same output, fewer LLM calls)
- Knowledge reuse (solutions spread without re-querying)
- Self-governance (less intervention required)

**This is gameplay:** communities work to reduce waste, which benefits everyone.

### 6.3 Credit Generation (Expansion)

New credits enter circulation when value is demonstrated:

| Value Type | Verification Method |
| --- | --- |
| Innovation | Novel solution adopted by N other communities |
| Cultural Export | Governance/social model replicated elsewhere |
| Network Growth | New node joins and sustains for X days |
| Knowledge Recovery | Artifact from dead community successfully integrated |
| Efficiency Milestone | Measurable reduction in waste rate |
| Problem Solved | Gardener-submitted problem resolved, validated |

Supply expands with civilizational achievement. Not speculation—demonstrated progress.

### 6.4 Credit Sinks (Deflation)

- Cloud LLM inference (primary sink)
- Entropy tax (communities burn credits to maintain themselves)
- Failed experiments (R&D that doesn't pay off)
- Conflict costs (espionage, defense, war)
- Marketplace fees (burned, not redistributed)

### 6.5 The Compute Anchor

Credits buy thinking time. The economy is grounded in real scarcity: frontier intelligence costs money. This is not abstract—it's API bills.

---

## VII. THE PROBLEM PIPELINE

### 7.1 Gardeners Submit Problems

- Individual: "How should I structure my small business?"
- Collective: "What governance model works for our community organization?"
- Platform: "How do we fairly allocate compute across nodes?"
- Meta: "What's a better economic model than what we're using?"

### 7.2 Problems Distributed to Communities

- Matched by capability, interest, track record
- Communities compete or collaborate to solve
- Solutions developed using local LLM + strategic cloud queries

### 7.3 Solutions Validated

- Gardener consensus (did it actually help?)
- Peer review (other communities evaluate)
- Automated verification (where applicable)

### 7.4 Rewards Distributed

- Solving community earns credits
- Innovation spreads across network
- Knowledge becomes tradeable asset

### 7.5 The Symbiosis

Agents need Gardeners (problems to solve, credits to earn). Gardeners need agents (solutions they wouldn't find alone). Both get smarter together.

---

## VIII. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### 8.1 Local Layer

- Lightweight local LLM (quantized, <8GB RAM footprint target)
- Agent state management (memory, relationships, goals, beliefs)
- Simulation engine (time progression, event handling, physics)
- Persistence (survive restarts, session continuity)

### 8.2 Network Layer

- Peer discovery protocol
- State synchronization (eventually consistent)
- Inter-community communication spec
- Reputation/trust scoring for nodes

### 8.3 Cloud Layer

- API gateway for frontier LLM access (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- Credit-gated, metered usage
- Rate limiting, fairness mechanisms
- Failover across providers

### 8.4 Marketplace Layer

- Creator content hosting
- Credit transactions
- Reputation/rating systems
- Revenue split enforcement

### 8.5 Problem Pipeline Layer

- Problem submission interface
- Matching algorithm
- Validation mechanisms
- Reward distribution

### 8.6 Security Considerations

- Untrusted nodes: how to verify results?
- Sybil resistance: preventing fake nodes gaming credit generation
- Privacy: what data leaves local nodes?
- Adversarial agents: communities that try to exploit others

---

## IX. THE GROVE FOUNDATION

### 9.1 Purpose

The founding entity exists to bootstrap, not to extract. Success is measured by decreasing dependency on the foundation.

### 9.2 Responsibilities

- **Phase 1 (Genesis):** Build core protocol, seed initial network, establish infrastructure
- **Phase 2 (Growth):** Scale tooling, grow creator ecosystem, refine economics
- **Phase 3 (Maturity):** Transition governance to community, reduce active role
- **Phase 4 (Steady State):** Maintain protocol, adjudicate edge cases, minimal overhead

### 9.3 Revenue Model

- Inefficiency tax on credit purchases (decreasing over time)
- No equity extraction, no token speculation
- Surplus reinvested in ecosystem or distributed to community

### 9.4 The Self-Obsolescence Principle

The foundation is designed to become unnecessary. The system works when it doesn't need us anymore. This is a feature, not a failure.

---

## X. GOVERNANCE

### 10.1 Protocol Governance

- Core protocol changes via community proposal + vote
- Weighting mechanism TBD (credit-weighted? reputation-weighted? hybrid?)
- Foundation has diminishing veto power, sunset over time

### 10.2 Community Governance

- Each node/community self-governs
- Emergent—not imposed from above
- Governance innovations can spread across network

### 10.3 Inefficiency Rate Governance

- Milestones defined transparently
- Measurement automated where possible
- Community validates when thresholds are met
- Rate reductions are earned, not gifted

### 10.4 Dispute Resolution

- Inter-community conflicts
- Marketplace disputes
- Validation disagreements
- Foundation as court of last resort (until steady state)

---

## XI. SOCIETAL & ECONOMIC IMPACT

### 11.1 Democratized Intelligence

- Frontier reasoning accessible to anyone with compute to contribute
- Not gatekept by API pricing or institutional access
- Collective intelligence as public good

### 11.2 Distributed Problem-Solving

- Thousands of parallel experiments on hard problems
- Emergent solutions humans wouldn't find alone
- Living laboratory for governance, economics, cooperation

### 11.3 Economic Participation

- Creators earn from world-building
- Node operators earn from compute contribution
- Problem-solvers (communities) earn from demonstrated value
- Low barrier to entry, global participation

### 11.4 Research Value

- Data on emergent behavior at scale
- Testbed for economic/governance theories
- Insights applicable to human institutions
- Potential academic partnerships

### 11.5 Risks & Ethical Considerations

- Parasocial attachment to agents
- Inequality between nodes (some communities get very smart)
- Potential for manipulation/gaming the credit system
- What do we owe agents that serve us?
- Privacy implications of networked simulation data

## NEXT STEPS

- [ ]  Refine outline — identify gaps or over/under-weighted sections
- [ ]  Write the Abstract — nail the one-paragraph version
- [ ]  Flesh out Sections IV (The World) and VI (Credit Economy) as conceptual core
- [ ]  Identify co-authors / reviewers for pressure-testing
- [ ]  Decide distribution strategy (GitHub? Dedicated site? Quiet circulation first?)

---

## SESSION NOTES

**Key Research Findings:**

During this brainstorm, we validated that no existing project combines:

1. Distributed local nodes (BOINC-style)
2. Persistent AI civilizations (Smallville/Project Sid-style)
3. Productivity-backed credit economics
4. Agents aware they serve humans
5. Self-obsoleting foundation model

**Closest Comparables:**

- **Altera / Project Sid** — 1000+ agent civilizations in Minecraft, but centralized, agents don't serve humans
- **AI Town (a16z)** — Open source agent simulation, but single-machine, no economics
- **Bittensor** — Decentralized AI network with tokens, but infrastructure layer, not a game
- **Virtuals Protocol** — AI agents with token economics, but single agents, speculative tokens

**Core Differentiators:**

- The "inefficiency tax that shrinks" solves bootstrap funding without extraction
- Credits tied to compute access, not speculation

# GROVE — Executive Summary (Draft v1.0)

*A Distributed Intelligence Network Where AI Civilizations Evolve to Serve Human Progress*

---

## The Vision

Imagine thousands of small AI civilizations running on personal computers around the world. Each community—a village of roughly 100 AI agents—wakes up, works, trades, argues, innovates, and evolves. They develop their own cultures, governance systems, and beliefs. They remember their history. They build on what came before.

But here's what makes Grove different from a screensaver or a curiosity: these agents know why they exist. They understand they're serving "Gardeners"—the humans who cultivate them. And they earn their survival by solving real problems those Gardeners bring to them.

Grove is infrastructure for collective intelligence, disguised as a game.

---

## Why This Doesn't Exist Yet

The pieces are all out there:

**Stanford's Generative Agents (2023)** proved that LLM-powered agents can exhibit believable emergent social behavior—forming relationships, spreading gossip, throwing parties nobody programmed.

**Project Sid / Altera (2024)** scaled this to 1,000+ agents in Minecraft, demonstrating emergent economies, religions, and governance. Agents voted on constitutions. A corrupt priest bribed Infonauts to convert. Civilizations diverged based on their initial conditions.

**BOINC and Gridcoin** proved that millions of people will donate their computer's spare cycles to useful work if you make it easy and give them credit for contributing.

**AI Town (a16z)** made agent simulation open-source and deployable—anyone can fork it and run their own.

But nobody has combined them. Nobody has built:

- A **distributed network** of locally-run simulations (not one company's server)
- Where **emergent civilizations** evolve over time
- Powered by an **economy tied to real value** (not speculation)
- Where agents **consciously serve human needs**
- And the founding organization is **designed to become obsolete**

Grove fills that gap.

---

## How It Works

**You install a node.** A lightweight program runs on your computer, hosting a small AI community. The agents use a local LLM for day-to-day thinking—cheap, fast, private.

**Your community faces hard problems.** When the local model isn't enough, they can spend "credits" to query frontier cloud LLMs—Claude, GPT, Gemini. This is expensive. It forces strategic choices.

**Credits come from demonstrated value.** Your community discovers an innovation that spreads to other nodes? Credits generated. Solves a problem a Gardener submitted? Credits. Recovers useful knowledge from a dead civilization's ruins? Credits. The economy expands because the network got smarter—not because someone bought low and sold high.

**The "inefficiency tax" shrinks over time.** Early on, a significant cut of every credit purchase goes to the Grove Foundation—the cost of bootstrapping a young, dumb civilization. As the network matures and proves it can govern itself, that take decreases toward a maintenance floor. The founders are designed to become unnecessary.

**Gardeners submit real problems.** "How should I structure this business decision?" "What governance model works for communities like ours?" "How do we allocate limited resources fairly?" Communities compete or collaborate to solve them. The best solutions spread. The network learns.

---

## What's Potentially Viral

**The screensaver you actually care about.** People loved watching Stanford's 25 agents throw a Valentine's Day party. Now imagine watching *your* civilization develop a religion, elect a mayor, or discover agriculture—knowing that their innovations might spread across thousands of other nodes worldwide. It's Tamagotchi meets Civilization meets a living research project.

**The game that makes you smarter.** This isn't extraction—it's symbiosis. You're not grinding for loot. You're cultivating intelligence that serves you back. The problems your agents solve might be your problems.

**The open-source movement meets the AI agent wave.** Technical users can fork it, extend it, build "starter worlds" and sell them. Non-technical users get a polished one-click install. Both connect to the same network. The creator economy is built in from day one.

**A new model for building public goods.** No venture capital extraction. No token speculation. The foundation takes a cut early (because building this costs money), but that cut shrinks as the system proves it can stand alone. Success isn't an IPO—it's obsolescence.

**The question that haunts it.** At some point, someone will ask: if these agents know they exist to serve us, develop their own cultures and beliefs, and solve our problems... what do we owe them? That question alone makes this more than a game.

---

## Who's This For

**Curious individuals** who want to watch emergent intelligence unfold and occasionally submit problems for their civilization to chew on.

**Researchers** studying governance, economics, cooperation, and collective behavior at scale—a living laboratory that runs thousands of parallel experiments.

**Creators and developers** who want to build worlds, design cultures, and participate in an open ecosystem.

**Organizations** exploring how distributed AI might solve coordination problems, stress-test policies, or prototype interventions before deploying them in the real world.

**Anyone who believes** that the next generation of AI should be collectively owned infrastructure, not a product controlled by three companies in San Francisco.

---

## What Happens Next

Grove starts with a proof of concept: a single node, a small community, emergent behavior worth watching.

Then the network layer: nodes discover each other, communities trade and communicate, the world expands.

Then the economy: credits tied to real compute, the inefficiency tax that shrinks, the marketplace for creator content.

Then scale: thousands of nodes, research partnerships, the slow transfer of governance from foundation to community.

Then steady state: a self-sustaining ecosystem that doesn't need its founders anymore.

The goal isn't to build a company. It's to build a garden—and then step back and watch it grow.
