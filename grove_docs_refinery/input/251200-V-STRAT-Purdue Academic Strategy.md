# Purdue: Academic Penetration

# **The Academic Power Map**

Universities have predictable power structures, and knowing who controls what determines your approach:

**The Board of Trustees** sets strategic priorities and approves major initiatives, but they don't originate ideas — they bless them. A trustee like Wayne can't unilaterally push something through; he can champion it, ask questions that signal interest, and connect you to the right internal people. His value is credibility and access, not direct authority.

**The President** (Mung Chiang at Purdue) is the key decision-maker for anything that touches institutional strategy. He's an engineer by training, which helps. But presidents are protective of their time — you'd need a warm intro or a compelling reason for them to engage.

**The VP of Research** (currently Theresa Mayer at Purdue) is often the right operational entry point. This role controls research strategy, manages large grant relationships, and oversees research centers. If Grove could be framed as a research initiative with external funding potential, this is the door.

**The Deans** — specifically the Dean of the College of Science and the Dean of Engineering — have their own strategic plans and would need to see how this fits. Computer Science sits under Science at Purdue.

**Corporate and Foundation Relations** handles major gifts and partnerships. If you're talking about soliciting donations from OpenAI, Google, etc., this office gets involved in structuring those relationships.

**How Wayne Would Work This**

The realistic path:

1. **Private conversation with you** to understand the vision and his role (the podcast is prep for this)
2. **Informal socialization** — Wayne mentions it to the President or Provost at a board event: "I've been looking at something interesting in distributed AI. There's a local angle with an Indianapolis company. Worth a conversation?" This plants a seed without requiring anyone to commit.
3. **Connect you to the VP of Research or a relevant Dean** — Wayne's intro gets you a meeting. You'd pitch Grove as: a research initiative with open-source principles, potential for external funding (tech company donations, NSF, DOD given the distributed compute angle), and an industry pipeline for graduates.
4. **Exploratory committee or working group** — if there's interest, the university would likely form a small group to evaluate: IP implications, resource requirements, fit with existing research. This is where it either gains momentum or dies.
5. **Board briefing** — if internal champions emerge, it could come to the board as an information item or a request for seed support. Wayne's prior socialization makes this easier.

**What Makes This Attractive to Purdue Specifically**

Purdue's positioning plays in your favor:

- **Mung Chiang's background** — he's a network theorist and engineer, previously at Princeton. Distributed systems and AI infrastructure are in his wheelhouse.
- **The Indianapolis corridor** — Purdue has been pushing the "Silicon Crossroads" narrative. An Indianapolis-based company with Purdue research ties fits that story.
- **Defense connections** — Purdue has deep DOD relationships. The geopolitical angle (not concentrating AI in corporate hands, building distributed compute resilience) could resonate with their defense-adjacent research interests.
- **Being the "Berkeley of X"** — Purdue doesn't have an iconic open-source project like BOINC. This is a gap they could fill.

**How the School Would Spin This**

If it works, here's the university communications framing:

> "Purdue leads new research initiative in distributed AI systems — partnering with industry to build open infrastructure for the next generation of intelligent systems. The Grove Project, housed at Purdue and supported by donations from [tech partners], will create a research hub and talent pipeline for Indiana's growing AI sector."
> 

That's the press release. It's about leadership, openness, jobs, and regional impact — not about the weird and wonderful details of AI civilizations evolving their own religions.
